		<text>Barman: “According to the documents you brought from Agroprom, things are starting to clear up, but some data is missing. There is evidence to suggest the presence of a “brain roaster” which blocks the road to the north, but no one knows exactly what it is. Also, there is mention of an X18 laboratory whose description matches that of abandoned dungeons in the Dark Valley. Its present activity is unknown and besides, bandits have now set up their base in the dark valley.\n Several Duty scouts went there very recently, but so far there is no news from them.\n To get inside the laboratory, you will need two electronic keys; I will give you one, but the second one you will have to take from Boar, the bandits' leader. \n\n So, you need to take the second key to the laboratory from Boar, then sneak inside the laboratory and secure the documents. Before doing  this you must acquire an anti-radiation suit because you won’t push through inside the dark valley without one – the radiation is too strong."</text>

		<text>A week ago it was decided to increase the intensity of radiation being delivered to test subjects. No changes were detected in the first few days. After several days strange metamorphoses started to occur: amount of hair decreased, aggressiveness heightened. Several subjects were literally trampled underfoot by their peers.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="documents_2">
		<text>Subjects' conditions have stabilized. The amount of hair is now 10% of the original. Their claws and teeth have grown considerably. Bursts of activity exhibit seemingly random behaviour and are not directed at equal peers. Senior lab technician A.N. Burnov speculated that this may indicate an increase in the subjects' intellects. It was decided to test the new modulation of PSI-radiation on the subjects.</text>

		<text>Chief of Security: Yesterday security guard G.P. Glebov tossed a piece of meat to the subjects just for fun. They tore apart and devoured it in mere seconds. Subsequently several individuals tried to break out of the cells. Because of this, lab technicians were unable to obtain the necessary test samples. Although G.P. Glebov's actions were ill-considered, I propose that maintenance personnel be equipped with airguns for adequate protection in the event of emergencies.</text>

		<text>Chief of Security: Yesterday the experiment almost got out of control. Two dozen test subjects broke out and ripped to shreds two laboratory rooms. Fortunately, the research personnel were able to lock themselves up upstairs. We were ordered to clear the main laboratory room. In the course of the operation three guards suffered bites. Hopefully, they will be OK. I wish they would finish up this experiment soon.</text>

	<string id="documents_5">
		<text>Yesterday we delivered new modulation of PSI-radiation to the test subjects. It appeared as though their brains simply got roasted. I can hardly imagine how this radiation would affect humans. We have tested every type of radiation and the results match those obtained in other laboratories. The experiment can now be considered complete. Presumably, in one week we will be ready to conduct the experiment on larger creatures.</text>

		<text>I had a strange dream. The colossal Chernobyl plant emerges in the twilight. Everything looks peaceful. A lonely man appears. I see him from behind against the background of the station. The wind starts to blow. Suddenly an avalanche of rats begins to disperse from the station in every direction. The man, with his back turned to me, shoots at the rats. There is an abrupt scream: "Sharpshooter!". The man shudders, freezes for a moment, then starts to turn slowly in my direction, but… just an instant before I am to get a glance at his face, I wake up. What does this dream mean? I don't know, but I think it's something I have seen before.</text>
