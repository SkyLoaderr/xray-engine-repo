        <text>Restricted. To: Leader, “THRUTH” project \nKGB colonel V.Ì. Kruchelnikov \nFrom: Commander, «Search-2» group, \ncaptain D.F. Maksimenko \n \n Report. \n \nOur group consisting of 3 investigators and the SBU SWAT unit from 12.05.2012 till 25.05.2012 has been inspecting the blocks of the former agricultural \nscientific and research institute on the contaminated lands of the scientific and research institute “Agroprom”. Most of the equipment and papers are lost or \nmissing but the few evidences found allow us to make the following conclusion: the institute was not conducting the scientific researches in the field of \nagriculture from 2005 till 2008. The results of its “work” reported to the Ministry of Agriculture were trumped up. Equipment, consumables and financing \nassigned for the state programs were at the same time passed by the institute direction in the person of its head Petr Danilovich Strizh by forged invoices to \nsome X-18 lab to carry out experiments in the secondary household of the institute. A group of persons involved in this case are likely to use some code name \nbecause there's no lab with such number database. According to the documents found we can assume that it lies at one hour driving distance from \n“Agroprom” institute. We suppose it to be a highly secret lab and that's why I require our analytic department to take part in its search. There's no possibility to \nclarify what this lab was actually engaged in relying on the information available. The found documents mention the notorious professor Chubko and some \nGroup. I'm deeply convinced that this time we have got the end of the thread and the analytic department will start working on it. There's an archived file in the \nattachment containing invoices on equipment and consumables for some secondary household of the institute and a passage from Strizh and Chubko \ncorrespondence. Captain D.F. Maksimenko 26.05.2012 Prof. V.M. Chubko. From Dr. of Agriculture P.D. Strizh Head the scientific and research institute \nAgroprom. Dear Vadim Michailovich, as agreed upon send you a regular lot of equipment and consumables for you experimental household so that you can \nproceed with your highly important for agricultural sphere researches. These experiments are financing as the natural experiments in the field of our institute, \nso the will be no problems with the Ministry. So how are the tests going on? I'm still impressed by what you've shown me last time. Yours sincerely, P.D. \nStrizh. Dr. of Agriculture P.D. Strizh. Thanks a lot, Petr Danilovich, we've got the delivery. My guys are frantic about the laser spectrometer and if not but you I \nwould have procured this model through my channels for ages. As to the Ministry of Agriculture it will be glad to get OUR results...you've made me, the old \nman, to laugh heartily. The experiments take it normal course and what you've seen last time is nothing in comparison with our present achievements. Come to \nvisit us more often - we are always glad to see you. Especially that it takes only one hour to get to our “experimental household”, as you name it, by car. \nAlmost forgotten, I have a news for you - next Monday I discuss you candidacy with the Group. I'm sure they will support me. Yours sincerely, Prof. \nV.M.Chubko. Prof.  V.M.Chubko. From Dr. of Agriculture Head of scientific and research institute Agroprom P.D. Strizh. Vadim Michailovich, thanks for trusting \nus. I'm deeply touched and will do my best to justify it. I'm sure that each scientist is looking forward to take part in such an experiment and I will be very happy \nto become part of the Group. Yours sincerely, P.D. Strizh. P.S. I have managed to secure two brand new Japanese broadband oscillographs in the Ministry \nand will handle them to you as soon as an opportunity occurs.</text>
