	<string id="tutorial_for_agroprom">
		<text>To all appearances the fighters in the former Agroprom Institute building have found something. I'm sure it is somehow related to the center of the Zone. So, that something the militaries dug out is guarded on the second floor of the Institute building. It seems that it's all about a small white case. Snatching it right from under SBU task force nose won't be an easy task at all. They are tough fighters. Be extremely watchful!
