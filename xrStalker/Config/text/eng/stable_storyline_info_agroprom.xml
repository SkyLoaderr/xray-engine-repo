        <text>Get down the spiral stairs to the room with columns. Walk through the room and approach the exit, find yourself in the large room with the pipes on the ceiling, proceed to the second exit, enter the pipe and turn left. In the end you'll find the path to the right. From the small room you move straight to the exit and turn right. Search for the hole in the wall, near the inscription "Warning! High voltage!". This is the entrance to Gunslinger's cache.</text>

        <text>You've asked me to inquire about the Gunslinger's cache. Here, listen what I have found. There is a factory not far away from Agroprom. You have to pass it around from the North. Not far from the breach in the fency you'll notice the entrance to the dungeon. Crawl in, you'll face the spiral stairs. Climb it down, and walk to the large room. There in the distant corner you'll find the cache. But beware of mutants, rumors say that they've densely occupied the dungeons. And don't you forget to share a bit with the one who shared information with you.</text>

        <text>Received from Ghost: \n \n Gunslinger, I've got a bad news. Fang passed on. We were awaited in the village nr the Warehouses. And it seems like for a really long time. Threesome. Looked like common neutrals. Fang has sensed them somehow. You know, he had the senses all the best. We croaked two of them - newbies, while the third one turned out to be wiser - he camped in 100 meteres armed with Vintorez. Well, Fang has ceased to be. Though, next time we'll go to the Center together. And one more thing: Those two had our descriptions. I don't give a damn to whom could "order" us. Although there are a lot of people who have grudge against us. The third one has fleed. It seems that he was one of the mercenaries. Severe scar on the face. Fair eye. I'll try to find him.\n That's the way the cookie crumbles. Stay alert and Good luck.\n Ghost \n \n To Ghost \n \n "Hi matey. \n I leave you the info. Although I don't contact you. Noticed the shadowing.\n Mate, I've gone to the North... Where we have been...I'll try to slip through alone... Sorry, but I've got no time to wait you... I'll explain later. \n And that idiot who dare to kill Fang will regret poking his ass in it... I'll cut his throat... You should find out who is he, I'll return soon - we'll deal there then. \n Meet at out mutual friend. You know which one and where.:)\n Good luck. \n Gunslinger" \n \n To Gunslinger. \n \n "Hi. I've been there. While I haven't met you. You shouldn't have gone to the center alone. Although you're your own man. I know where and how to find you :) \n Ghost"</text>
