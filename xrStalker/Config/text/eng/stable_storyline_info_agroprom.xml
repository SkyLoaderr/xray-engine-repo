        <text>Get down the spiral stairs to the room with columns. Walk through the room and approach the exit, find yourself in the large room with the pipes on the ceiling, proceed to the second exit, enter the pipe and turn left. In the end you'll find the path to the right. From the small room you move straight to the exit and turn right. Search for the hole in the wall, near the inscription "Warning! High voltage!". This is the entrance to Gunslinger's cache.</text>

        <text>Restricted. To: Leader, “THRUTH” project KGB colonel V.Ì. Kruchelnikov From: Commander, \n«Search-2» group, captain D.F. Maksimenko Report. In period from 12.05.2012 to 25.05.2012 our \ngroup incorporating with KGB task force detachment has been examining the facilities of  former \n“Agroprom” scientific research institute, which studied the problem of farming on lands contaminated  \nwith radioactivity.\n\nFor administrative use only. To the “VERITY” Project leader KGB Colonel V.M. Kruchelnikov. From \n“Poisk/Search-2” group leader captain D.F. Maksimenko. Report. Our group consisting of 3 \ninvestigators and the KGB SWAT unit from 12.05.2012 till 25.05.2012 has been inspecting the blocks \nof the former agricultural scientific and research institute on the contaminated lands of the scientific \nand research institute “Agroprom”. Most of the equipment and papers are lost or missing but the few \nevidences found allow us to make the following conclusion: the institute was not conducting the \nscientific researches in the field of agriculture from 2005 till 2008. The results of its “work” reported to \nthe Ministry of Agriculture were trumped up. Equipment, consumables and financing assigned for the \nstate programs were at the same time passed by the institute direction in the person of its head Petr \nDanilovich Strizh by forged invoices to some X-18 lab to carry out experiments in the secondary \nhousehold of the institute. A group of persons involved in this case are likely to use some code name \nbecause there's no lab with such number database. According to the documents found we can assume \nthat it lies at one hour driving distance from “Agroprom” institute. We suppose it to be a highly secret \nlab and that's why I require our analytic department to take part in its search. There's no possibility to \nclarify what this lab was actually engaged in relying on the information available. The found documents \nmention the notorious professor Chubko and some Group. I'm deeply convinced that this time we \nhave got the end of the thread and the analytic department will start working on it. There's an archived \nfile in the attachment containing invoices on equipment and consumables for some secondary \nhousehold of the institute and a passage from Strizh and Chubko correspondence. Captain D.F. \nMaksimenko 26.05.2012 Prof. V.M. Chubko. From Dr. of Agriculture P.D. Strizh Head the scientific \nand research institute Agroprom. Dear Vadim Michailovich, as agreed upon send you a regular lot of \nequipment and consumables for you experimental household so that you can proceed with your highly \nimportant for agricultural sphere researches. These experiments are financing as the natural \nexperiments in the field of our institute, so the will be no problems with the Ministry. So how are the \ntests going on? I'm still impressed by what you've shown me last time. Yours sincerely, P.D. Strizh. \nDr. of Agriculture P.D. Strizh. Thanks a lot, Petr Danilovich, we've got the delivery. My guys are \nfrantic about the laser spectrometer and if not but you I would have procured this model through my \nchannels for ages. As to the Ministry of Agriculture it will be glad to get OUR results...you've made \nme, the old man, to laugh heartily. The experiments take it normal course and what you've seen last \ntime is nothing in comparison with our present achievements. Come to visit us more often - we are \nalways glad to see you. Especially that it takes only one hour to get to our “experimental household”, \nas you name it, by car. Almost forgotten, I have a news for you - next Monday I discuss you \ncandidacy with the Group. I'm sure they will support me. Yours sincerely, Prof. V.M.Chubko. Prof.  \nV.M.Chubko. From Dr. of Agriculture Head of scientific and research institute Agroprom P.D. Strizh. \nVadim Michailovich, thanks for trusting us. I'm deeply touched and will do my best to justify it. I'm \nsure that each scientist is looking forward to take part in such an experiment and I will be very happy \nto become part of the Group. Yours sincerely, P.D. Strizh. P.S. I have managed to secure two brand \nnew Japanese broadband oscillographs in the Ministry and will handle them to you as soon as an \nopportunity occurs.\n\n</text>

        <text>You've asked me to inquire about the Gunslinger's cache. Here, listen what I have found. There is a factory not far away from Agroprom. You have to pass it around from the North. Not far from the breach in the fency you'll notice the entrance to the dungeon. Crawl in, you'll face the spiral stairs. Climb it down, and walk to the large room. There in the distant corner you'll find the cache. But beware of mutants, rumors say that they've densely occupied the dungeons. And don't you forget to share a bit with the one who shared information with you.</text>

        <text>Received from Ghost: \n \n Gunslinger, I've got a bad news. Fang passed on. We were awaited in the village nr the Warehouses. And it seems like for a really long time. Threesome. Looked like common neutrals. Fang has sensed them somehow. You know, he had the senses all the best. We croaked two of them - newbies, while the third one turned out to be wiser - he camped in 100 meteres armed with Vintorez. Well, Fang has ceased to be. Though, next time we'll go to the Center together. And one more thing: Those two had our descriptions. I don't give a damn to whom could "order" us. Although there are a lot of people who have grudge against us. The third one has fleed. It seems that he was one of the mercenaries. Severe scar on the face. Fair eye. I'll try to find him.\n That's the way the cookie crumbles. Stay alert and Good luck.\n Ghost \n \n To Ghost \n \n "Hi matey. \n I leave you the info. Although I don't contact you. Noticed the shadowing.\n Mate, I've gone to the North... Where we have been...I'll try to slip through alone... Sorry, but I've got no time to wait you... I'll explain later. \n And that idiot who dare to kill Fang will regret poking his ass in it... I'll cut his throat... You should find out who is he, I'll return soon - we'll deal there then. \n Meet at out mutual friend. You know which one and where.:)\n Good luck. \n Gunslinger" \n \n To Gunslinger. \n \n "Hi. I've been there. While I haven't met you. You shouldn't have gone to the center alone. Although you're your own man. I know where and how to find you :) \n Ghost"</text>
