		<text>An anomaly of unknown nature. On contact with human body inflicts injuries similar to the effects of a strong acid. Forms three types of artifacts: "Slime", "Slug", and "Mica".</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_zone_anomalies_bald">
		<text>One of the first anomalies ever recorded - a field of altering gravity inflicting shock damage to anyone within its radius. Remains stationary for a week on average. The amount of damage inflicted can vary in its lifetime, ranging from minor bruises, through serious wounds, to instant death. Easy to spot in daylight, recognizable by air fluctuation above the anomaly, dancing leaves and distinctive crimson-colored stains on the ground. Can be revealed by any type of detector, and by throwing objects into it. Forms three types of artifacts: "Jellyfish", "Stone Flower" and "Night Star".</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_zone_anomalies_electra">
		<text>An anomalous formation, roughly 10 yards in diameter, accumulating static electricity in vast quantities. When triggered, the anomaly bursts out in dozens of miniature lightnings, causing electric shock, nearly always lethal for all living beings. Recognizable by the bluish fog hovering above it in daylight. At nighttime the "Electra" can be revealed by any type of detector, or by throwing metal objects into the anomaly. Forms three types of artifacts: "Sparkler", "Flash" and "Moonlight".</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_zone_anomalies_fuzz">
		<text>Mutated vegetation. Reacts to rapidly approaching living beings by discharging a cloud of projectiles, severely injuring uncovered or lightly protected skin upon contact. Does not react to slowly moving targets. Forms three types of artifacts (possibly its seeds): "Spiker", "Crystal Spiker" and "Urchin".</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_zone_anomalies_gravi">
		<text>An anomaly of presumably gravitational nature. When triggered, the tremendous power of the "Graviconcentrate" drags everything within the radius of 10-15 yards into its center. Victims drawn into the core have no chance of survival: the bodies of animals and human beings alike are quickly constricted into a tight lump, only to be blown up a moment later in a powerful discharge of energy. The anomaly remains stationary throughout its lifetime (a week on average). It can be visually detected in daylight by the air fluctuation above, dancing leaves, fragments of dismembered corpses lying around, and a distinctive dark stain in the center. Highly dangerous at night since it can be revealed only by means of a detector, or by throwing metal objects into it. Forms three types of artifacts: "Wrencher", "Gravi" and "Goldfish". </text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_zone_anomalies_lift">
		<text>A harmless anomaly, temporarily negating the laws of gravity. Manifests itself as an area, usually several yards in diameter, where the gravitational forces of Earth are greatly reduced. Forms the "Cobweb" artifact.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_zone_anomalies_meat">
		<text>The name of the anomaly stems from its snatching any living being up in the air and spinning it a breakneck speed. The exact nature of the "Meatgrinder" remains unknown. The anomaly can be recognized by a light whirlwind of dust and by body fragments scattered in the vicinity. Can be escaped with minor injuries while the victim is on its outer rim - far enough from the maximum effect zone at the center. Forms three types of artifacts: "Stone Blood", "Meatball" and "Soul".</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_zone_anomalies_radioactive">
		<text>An area of increased radiation - over 50 mR/h. Prolonged stay in a radiated zone is strongly discouraged.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_zone_anomalies_time">
		<text>A little miracle of an anomaly: an area several yards in diameter where the natural time flow is greatly reduced. Appears to have no negative effect on human health. However, can be very difficult to get out of. Interestingly, removal of "Mama's beads" - an artifact usually found in the center of the anomaly, causes the "Time Machine" to disappear.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_zone_anomalies_zharka">
		<text>While inactive, the anomaly manifests itself as a barely visible cloud of hot air. When triggered by an object or a living being it instantly heats up to lethal temperatures approaching 1500K. At nighttime it can be revealed by powerful detectors or by throwing metal objects into the trigger area. Forms three types of artifacts: "Sprays", "Fireball" and "Crystal".</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_zone_artifact_af-ameba-mica">
		<text>An artifact formed in the "Witches' Jelly" anomaly. A translucent, jelly-like object of unknown nature, known to almost instantly nourish the body with nutrients, drive out radiation and stop bleeding. At the same time, however, it makes the bearer extremely susceptible to electric, chemical and thermal injury. High value. The artifact is of primary interest to scientific, primarily medical, organizations.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_zone_artifact_af-ameba-slime">
		<text>An artifact formed in the "Witches' Jelly" anomaly.

	<string id="enc_zone_artifact_af-blood">
		<text>An artifact formed in the "Meatgrinder" anomaly. A deformed, reddish object made of compressed, oddly twisted, polymerized scraps of plants, soil and bones. A popular superstition among stalkers is that the strength of people perished in the anomaly is contained in the artifact. Carrying the "Stone Blood" artifact on your belt slightly speeds up the healing process, though in result the human flesh softens up and becomes temporarily more susceptible to injury. In addition, healing requires ample nutrients, lack of which may quickly cause exhaustion. Radioactive. Quite common, hence not very valuable. The artifact is of primary interest to scientific, primarily medical, organizations and various cult members.</text>

Be sure to check out the "100 Roentgen" bar in the vaults - it's a meeting point for stalkers from the entire Zone. The bar is run by the local trader, so if you're interested in selling or buying wares apart from the local gossip - that's the place to go to. North of the bar is the military base, with the Dump to the South.</text>

A place frequented by some of the most experienced old-timers, as well as common bandits. There's supposed to be an underground lab around there somewhere, so it might be worth to look for a hidden entrance along the way. No one has returned from there alive though, and no one can tell for sure just what nasty surprises await you there.</text>

Don't miss the chance to chit-chat with him. You'd be advised to steer clear of the outpost itself. You don't want the soldiers to catch a sight of you - most of them shoot first and don't bother asking questions later. However, there are some, who can be bribed, as long as the top brass is looking the other way. Attacking soldiers is not recommended, unless they pose a direct threat.</text>

Anyone who dares to go too far goes mentally deranged. Zombie drones are rambling around the whole sector, waiting for anyone they catch sight of, with intentions that are hardly peaceful. Walking around the lake and the zombies you’ll end up in the scientists' camp where the eggheads brought there by choppers are doing some research.

	<string id="enc_zone_zone-story_story-2006">
		<text>The contamination zone was aglow with the brightest of lights, almost unbearable to the human eye. One could virtually see the clouds in the sky turning into vapor. A moment of dead silence was followed by rattling thunder, and then the earth shook. People fell to the ground, screwing up their eyes and covering their ears. Those who could still stand ran for their lives. From the outside it looked as though all the nuclear fuel buried under the Sarcophagus had suddenly exploded. The next day the government troops cordoned off the new Zone. With the help of satellites it was discovered that the epicenter of the explosion was not in the vicinity of the NPP reactors, but about half a mile away. It is believed that the whole personnel of the station died at once, though many people still remained within the cordoned area. The rescue operations soon proved to be a pointless endeavor, as all the people and machinery sent deep into the affected area would die or malfunction immediately. A little while after the disaster the Zone diameter hopped out by a few more miles. Most of the government troops guarding the area border line and the research labs stationed there perished instantly.
