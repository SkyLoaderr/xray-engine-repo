    <string id="enc_zone_anomalies_bald">
        <text>This anomaly was found one of the first in the Zone in 2008. It delivers a blow with its gravity force like air-blast by \nexplosion. She resides in the same place average once a week. During its life time it changes force of effect, which varies \nfrom bruise to instant death "launching body on the orbit". It can be recognized by distorted air above it, whirling leaves \nand typical red-drown spots; these are places of loser's and stupid novice's starts. Can be well discovered by all kind of \ndetectors and by throwing different metal things into it. Randomly generates tree kind of artifacts "Medusa" "Crystal Flower" \nand "Night star"</text>

    <string id="enc_zone_anomalies_electra">
        <text>This anomalous formation accumulates static electricity in some area in radius of 40 feet. Disturbed anomaly explodes \nwith dozen of lightning. Electric shock almost always is fatal. Typical feature of this anomaly is visible bluish mist over it. It \ncan be well disclosed by any kind of detectors, and by throwing different metal things into it. Randomly generates such \nartifacts as "Electra", "Electra flesh" or "Electra moon light".</text>

    <string id="enc_zone_anomalies_fuzz">
        <text>It's anomaly vegetation. By approaching it egests cloud of particles which injures human like stinging sell. It generates \ntree \ntypes of seed-artifacts: "Thorn", "Kristal thorn", "Sea urchin".</text>
    </string>
    <string id="enc_zone_anomalies_gravi">
        <text>This an anomaly of gravity nature. It's like little black hole. It absorbs with enormous strength everything appeared in radius \nof 30-40 feet into its center. It's very important not to miss the beginning of absorption and don't get into the zone of \nmaximum effect. In this case you won't get only bruises- this anomaly is always fatal dangerous. The anomaly squeezes a body \nin some clod, breaks ones bones and after accumulating some critical mass, in moment of nucleus discharge, tears this body \napart. In this moment anomaly throws about products of compression, forming new artifacts. During its life time this \nanomaly doesn't change location and slightly alternates power of effect. It resides on one place ca. one week. One can reduce \nits influence carrying on the belt such artifacts as “Medusa”, “Crystal flower” and “Night star” Can be recognized by seeing \ndistorted air above it, whirling leaves, dismembered animal corpses and typical dark spot in the center on the ground. This \nanomaly can be disclosed only by special detectors, or by throwing any metal things into it. It usually generates tree types of \nartifacts “Vyvert”, “Gravity” and “Golden fish”.</text>

    <string id="enc_zone_anomalies_lift">
        <text>It is harmless anomaly. It allows for some time to forget about terrestrial gravity. In some local place of several feet \nterrestrial gravity greatly decreases. Constant drifting in it allows getting out. The only unfavorable moment is that, you can \nbe easily shot by opponents. It generates “Dummy pellicle” artifact.</text>

    <string id="enc_zone_anomalies_meat">
        <text>The funny name of this anomaly is determined by its effect. When any living being got into it the anomaly lift it up, rotate \nand tears out all extremities. It is extremely dangerous. The nature of this vortex like anomaly isn't clear yet. It can be \nrecognized by noticing light dust vortex and body members of animals and people around it. It's very important not to miss \nthe beginning of absorption and don't get into the zone of maximum effect. It usually generates tree types of artifacts \n“Mincer blood”, “Mincer Meatloaf” and “Mincer soul”.

        <text>This anomaly surely can be called a miracle. In the radius of several feet the time is slowing down. It doesn't effect the \nhealth but you spend a lot of time to get out from there. You can also smart lure enemies into it and give a flight to your \nimagination. Usually in the center there is an spiral-like artifact "Dummy-glassbeads".

Everything within “Zharka” instantly burns, and mostly dies. The danger of this anomaly is \nbecause of it constant motion by random routes. The positive moment is it disclosures of other anomalies so you can follow it \nwithout surprise. This anomaly can be disclosed only by special detectors, or by throwing any metal things into it. It generates \nsuch artifacts as “Zharka drops”, “Zharka fire ball” and “Zharka crystal”.</text>

You will meet veterans by all means, they earn money there, pulling artifacts right out of the \nbum. I heard they talk about Sluggers band, they say they appeared again. As a matter of fact who knows may be they \nwere all shot. There's an entrance into the laboratory, but no one returned out of there, so I don't advise to go there... \nMay be dwarfs or may be something worse...</text>

        <text>This is a  threshold, military border. Novices walk around there growing roots in the Zone. Behind the village in the cellar \nyou find  the trader. I advise not butt into the blockpost and stike a soldiers eyes, they have an order to shoot without \nwarning. But some of them become kinder as they see money. In general if there's no command they can even let you \nthrough...when you're lucky. You cannot kill soldiers, only in emergency. For each killed trader must pay and he is not \nhappy by that kind of things. \n  </text>

        <text>It's a big foul damp after meltdown in 1986 it was filled with piles of radioactive trash-broken crans and machinery. One \ncan find old buildings remains. One can meet mutants. Mostly novices walking around here and bandits. You can find \nminor artifacts but it's better not to stay for a long time here. You can reach other interesting places from here. If you go \nto the North you reach the Rostok plant,the passage to the Dark Valley is to the West and to the East is the road to the \nAgroprom institute. You cannot go to the Dark Valley without radiation protection. The dose of radiation there kill you \nduring one day.  </text>

If you manage to walk \nround the lake and zombies you will find scientific camp there. They study something there.
