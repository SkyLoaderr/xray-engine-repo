        <text>You are supposed to be that guy Wolf has been talking about? Well it’s up to you now, basically there are not so many bandits there. Although we can hardly penetrate it together. Sniper has settled on the first floor staring at all passing nearby. If it were not for him – we would punish them swiftly.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_factory_assault_hello_3">
        <text>So, will you take out the sniper? In other way we won’t poke a sinlge nose there. At least soberly.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_factory_assault_talk_0">
        <text>Now, gentlemen, what would you say?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_factory_assault_talk_1">
        <text>All standing. Bandits are still at the ruins. Few people plus sentry on the first floor.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_factory_assault_talk_11">
        <text>I suggest attacking the factory altogether.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_factory_assault_talk_111">
        <text>No way we will have felt this on our own skins. But don’t think that we’re afraid of. We aren’t scared at all. Unless occasionally… maybe it’s a bit scary now… well, okay, we are afraid. And won’t you be afraid of soberly penetrating the factory with the dug in bandits inside? And that sniper there. I’d say that vodka can encourage us, in other way it’s impossible.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_factory_assault_talk_112">
        <text>Oh, I see that you’ve brought “fire-water”. Well if it continues as it is, we’ll not only drive all the bandits away from the factory, but even clear the whole Zone! So, attack?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_factory_assault_talk_1121">
        <text>Well, I’ll tell you when. Now take this bottle.</text>

    <string id="escape_factory_assault_talk_1122">
        <text>Wait a second. “Fire-water” isn’t for you.</text>

        <text>Okay.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_factory_assault_talk_2">
        <text>Ready and waiting. You just give an order.</text>

        <text>Well, fellows! Let’s kick arses! Assault!</text>

    <string id="escape_factory_assault_talk_22">
        <text>So be it! I’ll return in a moment.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_factory_attackers_11">
        <text>At last Wolf has sent help! Okay, listen, we’re going to knock bandits out of the factory, but the 2nd floor is ocupated by one prudent goggleeyed bastard and looks right into our direction. Silence won’t make any good there. Your task – to insensibly infiltrate the factory and give him a beat. As soon as we notice him missing, we’ll force our way in.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_factory_attackers_111">
        <text>Clear. I’m gonna lay him down.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_factory_attackers_112">
        <text>Maybe it would be better to attack the factory all together?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_factory_attackers_1121">
        <text>You chicken out, aren’t you? Me too, I’m not for so long in Zone as well, if you wanna stay alive it’s better not to show yourself. Vodka should be good here, for bravery.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_factory_attackers_11211">
        <text>Ah, I wish I had vodka now.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_factory_attackers_112111">
        <text>Perhaps you should visit trader then? If you don’t want to make a silent assault.</text>

        <text>Fine. I’ll be back soon.</text>

        <text>I have to think about it, and look around… well, you understand. I’ll catch up with ya latter.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_factory_attackers_12">
        <text>Well, have you thought it out? Able to take off that basterd from the 2nd floor? No other chances to approach, I think.</text>

        <text>Thanks.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_fox_flame_dialog_2">
        <text>Fox, tell me whether you have been to the Zone. What have you seen?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_fox_flame_dialog_21">
        <text>Such a story may take a few days to tell, and my time costs a lot. Can only give you a piece of advice. "Dump" – located 3 kilometers to the North from where I stand, where all the radioactive trash had been taken to from stations in 86th. Heavy radiation, host of anomalies, and ultimately – abundance of artifacts, admittedly not valuable. Beware of the bandits and try not to swear at “Duty” patrols. Scientific research institute “Agroprom” is to the west from the “Dump”. Region is quite poor regarding the artifacts, so I don’t go there often. “Dark Valley” to the east. Sort of weird place. Like it’s rather quiet in there, but bandits and stuff can now and then be met. Yet I sense that not everything is so simple there as it seems. Further beyond the Dump is “Rostok” factory territory – stalkership heart. Besides many experienced guys you can come across with.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_fox_flame_dialog_211">
        <text>What do one have to beware of in these lands?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_fox_flame_dialog_2111">
        <text>Hey, Marked, you look like an experienced guy, but for such foolish questions. Be wary of everything! This is the bloody Zone, can’t you see?! However bloodsuckers appeared at the night on the Dump, they haven’t been seen so far away from the center. Eerie vermins. It’s quite hard to see them during the day, if not to mention the night.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_fox_flame_dialog_3">
        <text>Trader said that you can know something about the Gunslinger.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_fox_flame_dialog_31">
        <text>Many have been interested in him recently. Truthfully I don’t know him personally. But I do have err.. “contact” experience. His grouping has once fired upon my boys. No one was hurt – they’ve been probably waiting for the other ones, thus I consider it to me a misunderstanding. Fouled each other over the ravine and left. O, by the way, Grey is waiting for me at the garage at the Dump, I’ll send you the coordinates, chat with him. We knows a lot more.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_fox_flash_dialog_0">
        <text>I’m from the trader, you have to hand something to him.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_fox_flash_dialog_1">
        <text>Take it, and try not to lose. Important information.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_fox_hello_dialog_2">
        <text>Hey, I’m waiting for a man here, so you’d better to get out of here sooner the better.</text>

        <text>Hi.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_access_0">
        <text>Why can’t I get into the camp?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_access_1">
        <text>One has to be a total dunce to let a man from the “death truck” in. First prove that you can be trusted.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_access_11">
        <text>What’s the “death truck”? I can’t remember anything.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_access_111">
        <text>I know few, but this few is something really really bad. Ultimately talking on this topic, especially with you, is not what I’m gonna do. Call it superstition if you wish. So begone, Marked, in an amicable way.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_access_12">
        <text>What must I do to make you believe me?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_access_121">
        <text>The trader must examine you, and we’ll just get acquainted. If you are a normal one, don’t grip the gun naively and generally familiar with your reason, we’ll find common language.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_guard_start_dialog_2">
        <text>Marked, stop, there is no way for you to the camp now!</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_guard_start_dialog_3">
        <text>Hi, Marked. What do you need?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_hlam_hello_0">
        <text>Greetings. Wish to sell something?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_hlam_talk_people_0">
        <text>You are familiar with majority here. What has this crowd gathered here for?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_hlam_talk_people_1">
        <text>Yeah, it’s hard to say unambiguously, from doctors of science to laid-back bandits. Everyone receives the task to its wit. Militaries usually guard the perimeter, rarely entering the Zone. Bandits are settled on the stalkers’ paths. May bereave of bribe or even life. Scientists are set somewhere deep inside it, searching for the bloody truth, idiots! There are several stalkers’ clans, but that’s another matter. People here in the camp are rather quiet and peaceful this is understood – freshly, anxious newbies. Unless the “Wolf” is familiar in here. This one has seen a lot, but to my mind he’s a bit freaky with stalkership and all, he wants to cut off.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_hlam_talk_people_2">
        <text>You’ve mentioned some stalkers’ clans. Can you give more specified information?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_hlam_talk_people_21">
        <text>You see, it’s really hard to survive in the Zone by yourself. So such clans are gathering here and there. Some for convictions, some for money. But there are  lots of free stalkers, as I am. Everyone is free to chose: join someone or act alone on own hazard and fear. Concerning groupings I can give roundup on the “Duty”, “Mercenaries” and “Monolith”</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_hlam_talk_people_3">
        <text>Concerning the bandits. Why not to perish them once and for all? Admittedly everyone has weapons.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_hlam_talk_people_31">
        <text>Well, generally we’re trying to do that. But if ones are shot, another come.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_hlam_talk_people_4">
        <text>Tell me about the “Duty” grouping.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_hlam_talk_people_41">
        <text>These consider themselves to be Zone hags. They think that the Zone is the malignant growth on the Earth body, and going to clear the Earth from the Zone and its inhabitants, haven’t yet decided how indeed. Thus shot all the mutants without distinction.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_hlam_talk_people_5">
        <text>Tell me about the “Mercanaries” grouping.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_hlam_talk_people_51">
        <text>Generally those have gathered there are not satisfied by the war in the “outer world”. Extreme Zone conditions shooting enthusiasts. Ready to fulfil any, even the most dirty work. Well equipped, by occidental weapons in majority.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_hlam_talk_people_6">
        <text>Tell me about the “Monolith” grouping.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_hlam_talk_people_61">
        <text>Why they’re kind of strange ones. Don’t gather artifacts. Don’t make any liaisons. Don’t trade. Believe in some crap like aliens and evolutional module inside the center of the zone, which shall change the civilization on the earth for good. But these are rumors. I haven’t had personal contacts with them.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_hlam_talk_people_611">
        <text>And do you yourself believe in something? What’s in the center of Zone?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_hlam_talk_people_6111">
        <text>I believe that even the most intimate dreams are granted in the center of the Zone. But I don’t have a clue what’s in there. I trust that some day I will be able to make it there.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_novice_start_dialog_2">
        <text>Hi, Marked. How can I be useful?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_novice_start_dialog_3">
        <text>How did you get here!? You mustn’t be at the camp!</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_volk_dynamite_done_0">
        <text>Take this present. Sorry that it isn’t packed properly.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_volk_dynamite_done_1">
        <text>Hehe. Thanks. My compliments with splendid fireworks. Take the money.</text>

        <text>Well, hi. Whatcha want?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_volk_hello_12">
        <text>Hello. I was told that you had saved one of ours from mere death. Thanks, man. Take this artifact as the sign of our gratitude. You can exchange it at Trader’s on weapons, shell or food.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_volk_hello_13">
        <text>How did you pass the guards!? You can’t go inside the camp, Marked! Leave, while you’re alive!</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_volk_info_0">
        <text>Got a few questions.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_volk_info_1">
        <text>Shoot. I’ll do my best to help ya.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_volk_info_10">
        <text>Thanks.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_volk_info_2">
        <text>What do you know about the Zone?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_volk_info_21">
        <text>Well, quite a lot. What do you particularly need.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_volk_info_211">
        <text>What’s inside the Zone?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_volk_info_2111">
        <text>This is the very question, which I wanted to find the answer to last two years. But the safe path to the center of the Zone hasn’t been found yet. Several times I tried to break through with my friends. I have hardly made it to return, my friends haven’t. If you ask how we got there, I’ll tell ya that we were seeking for the dream, for the wish master.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_volk_info_21111">
        <text>Why do you think that the dreams are to come true there?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_volk_info_211111">
        <text>There is a stalkers’ legend of the “wish master”. A place located in the center of the Zone, where all, even the most incredible, wishes come true. But you know what I’ll tell ya, I do know that there is the mere death in the center of the Zone, and that “master” is noteworthy. So, don’t run risks in vain.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_volk_info_212">
        <text>Where has the Zone come from?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_volk_info_2121">
        <text>Well, something boomed in 2006. Then it came. I know that this is barely an answer, but believe me that the truth is clear to very few.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_volk_info_213">
        <text>What has led you inside the Zone?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_volk_info_2131">
        <text>You unprofitable mine has been closed in 2008. Insufficient money. Then the rumors came about the Zone to give a chance to grow rich. I had no lack of army experience, so I ventured to do it. I can’t say that I an extremely rich now, but I’ve got a fair bit of brass behind my back. Typical story, as well as many others.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_volk_info_214">
        <text>What’s the most dangerous in the Zone?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_volk_info_2141">
        <text>Well, it’s hard to say. There are so many things still dangerous and unknown that I’ve hardly seen the whole enchilada. My body is the vivid example of the Zone’s dangers: bit off toe, thinned hair over the radiation, right hip burnt in “Zharka”, bloody thing by the way. Anomaly which isn’t standing on the same place, but flying. Had a face to face contact with the bloodsucker once. I dread even recollecting it. Basically we can talk it through and through, but if you haven’t felt it on your skin – you won’t understand. Just one advice – be careful.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_volk_info_3">
        <text>Have you heard anything about the Gunslinger?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_volk_info_31">
        <text>Kind of tough stalker to my mind. Not really familiar with him. However I’ve been wandering at the center of the Zone too long ago, and here to the boundsthere are quite a lot of newbies. You ought to talk to somebody working in the depth of the Zone.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_volk_info_4">
        <text>What do you know about the “death trucks”?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_volk_info_41">
        <text>I don’t know anything at all. Sorry, I see that you’re from there. But it’s too mystified. But working a bit in the Zone makes you superstitious indeed. Corpses in the body, dead men at the wheels… Who they are? Where have they come from… Hope not from the other side.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_volk_job_0">
        <text>Got any work?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_volk_job_1">
        <text>I’ve been too long inside the Zone. And I’m really sick and tired of it. And that will do! I got friends in the “outer world”. But before that I’d like to leave the present to one of my friends. Guys were carrying it to me, but those bandits perished them. So this present must be returned. I just don’t want to hazard my life before leaving. And you’re new here, and most certainly need money. I’ll pay you few grands. Well… those bandits are now settle at the factory.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_volk_job_11">
        <text>Okay, deal. Just tell what to fetch.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_volk_job_111">
        <text>Agree. Ah, the present… nothing extraordinary, just a case with dynamite… If you need any help – there are our guys nearby the factory making an ambush to the bandits. Talk to them – they may help.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_volk_job_12">
        <text>No way, deal with it yourself.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_volk_job_121">
        <text>What’s up, too scared? Well it’s okay, I’m not offended.</text>

        <text>There is nothing.</text>

    <string id="escape_talk_about_escape_0">
        <text>Tell me about this place.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_talk_about_escape_1">
        <text>This is the road inside the Zone. Trader can be found in the cellar beyond the village near the army post. I don’t advise you to poke your nose in the army post, cos soldiers are directed to fire on sight… Killing soldiers isn’t allowed, only if worst comes to worst, trader will pay off on his own and he won’t be satisfied with that. Packs of blind dogs on the plains, perilously for the newbies. Mutants visit it now and then.</text>

        <text>Well cut it off. The time will come and you’ll get everything. Can only admit that I need a “special” man for the “special” job. Don’t you know such guy? Hehe.</text>

    <string id="escape_trader_done_gift_21">
        <text>Generally speaking, “Agroprom” handed the thing I really need to the army post. White plastic case. It has to be stolen. Just be careful. When miliraties resent they make so much noise here, that even rats scatter. If I were you I would try to make it at night and as quiet as possible. </text>

    <string id="escape_trader_done_gift_2111">
        <text>Nothing special in it. Plastic white grip-sack. Why I do need the very thing inside it. These documents – preliminary report on the military expedition to “Agroprom”.</text>

    <string id="escape_trader_jobs_5">
        <text>Got an order on “Gravity” or “Twist” anomalies. I don’t really care where you find it, but I can aim ya: there is an accumulation of Gravity anomalies to the north from the factory, artifacts may be often found somewhere there. By the way if there will be no artifacts, just wait until someone traps into the anomaly, dog of human, doesn’t matter. Anomaly will make artifact out of him in a moment. </text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_jobs_51">
        <text>Generally speaking, “Agroprom” handed the thing I really need to the army post. White plastic case. It has to be stolen. Just be careful. When miliraties resent they make so much noise here, that even rats scatter. If I were you I would try to make it at night and as quiet as possible. </text>

        <text>Well, has just appeared. I’m conducting kind of investigation. Tell you later. Well, you must contact the person, who’s carrying important information. He’s called Fox. He doesn’t want to be put on view here, so meet him at the khutor behind the bridge. I’ll send you the coordinated. By the way, Marked. He isn’t a newbie so far so you can ask him on your matter.

        <text>To make it short, Marked, I’ve saved you and I won’t play dignified. Conduct some tasks for me and we’re done. Besides we’ll see how fast will your head restore from amnesia, and I’ll try to find about your case. A hell knows why do you need that Gunslinger, I don’t care of the outside problems.

        <text>Î! That’s how we do that. Listen then: \n There is the “Mincer” anomaly field nearby. And the artifact in the center. Local novices from the camp are afraid to poke in there. Well it’s scattered somewhere there for about a week. It’s written all over your face that you’re not a newbie, although you remember nothing. So even in such condition you’ll manage to bag it. Okay. Get to the job. I’ve sent the coordinates of that place to your PDA along with the information on the Mincer and its artifacts. </text>

        <text>I need answers on several questions. </text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_1">
        <text>Shoot, but I know few. You see, I’m stuck here for the eternity, while the real life is outside in the Zone. </text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_10">
        <text>Thanks for the information. </text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_2">
        <text>What are the militaries doing in the Zone? </text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_21">
        <text>Military guard it, what else can they do. The one thing I don’t get is whether they protect outside world form the Zone, or Zone from the outside world. Yep, I still don`t get it. Military expeditions sometimes come here. Must be searching for something. But I tell you, military men do not respect the Zone, and Zone pays back the same. Lots of then found they dead end here. Yep, dead.\nWhat, tell more? Well, those guys look down on us all, like some kind of supreme beings. Don`t give a damn about stalker laws, never help, even in the worst possible situation. No, lying, they can soot you, but not out of pity. Its just runs in their blood: Shoot first, think later. But I and they deal pretty well. Vodka, men magazines, in exchange for my private peace. So I advise you not to bother them in vain.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_3">
        <text>Tell me about the Zone.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_31">
        <text>Zone... is not just a peace of territory 40 kilometers in diameter, with its center near the nuclear plant. Zone is really strange being. I don`t think there is a person in this world who can give you a definite answer on your question. Because Zone is something not from this reality. I think it`s another world. Dangerous, strange, but, damn, it`s attractive. It`s like Eldorado, there even the most miserable bum can became very, very rich. And the deeper you go into the Zone, the closer you come to your fortune.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_311">
        <text>And what’s so dangerous in this “other world”?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_3111">
        <text>He, he. Nothing dangerous, besides that you can die any second. And not from the bullet of stupid military, by the way there are a lot of this guys lately. Must also tell, that be killed with a shot is the nicest death here. Really nice, compared with dying in anomaly - invisible death is the scariest one. Even mutants try to avoid them. Mutants, yes, “children” of the Zone. \nNasty creatures, tell ya. So you better don`t go to the Zone without a gun.  And talk to stalkers, they are good advisers as for the Zone.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_312">
        <text>Rich? I would like to know more about getting rich...</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_3121">
        <text>Dude, don`t tell me you know nothing about artifacts. They are the source of your wealth. People outside pay good dough for these souvenirs form the Zone. They are more dear then gold and diamonds. Because no gold can draw aside bullet that heads right into your belly. And artifacts do this, and many other funny and useful things. You can get most common ones even here, but to find a treasure, you`ll have to go to heart the Zone.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_313">
        <text>And what lies there, in the heart of the Zone?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_3131">
        <text>People tell a lot, if interested, ask other stalkers. But I don`t believe in this mystic staff. I do believe that in the center of the Zone lies an Eldorado, a place rich in artifacts. But I met no people who could either confirm, or deny it.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_4">
        <text>Any ideas of what happened to me?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_41">
        <text>Son, you ask hell of questions. Everything is shady about it. You where found in the death truck - vehicles loaded with corpses sometimes appear from the center of the Zone.  Where they head to, no one know. You truck crashed – bad luck, but you stayed alive. This is the most intriguing fact to me. Stalkers often find broken death trucks, but never found any survivals. Sorry, have nothing more to tell. You`ll have to figure it out yourself.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_5">
        <text>Who is Gunslinger? You know this guy?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_51">
        <text>I think I heard of this stalker. Rumors tell he is one of few, who got to the center of Zone. Well, there are a lot of legends about “stalker who made it to the center and back”. So, can`t guaranty the story is true, I personally had no business with him. Maybe he works with other dealers. Want to find him, ask stalkers, maybe some of them will tell you a way.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_6">
        <text>Spectral stalker, heard of him?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_61">
        <text>Its another legendary man. Not heard about him for a long time. He must have died somewhere deep in the Zone.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_level_0">
        <text>Tell me about this place.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_level_1">
        <text>Suburbs of the Zone, military cordon. In general it is usually calm and quite here, just military guys have fun sometimes. Stalkers only pass by, only freshmen linger on, and sometimes forever, hehe. There is the novices’ camp set nearby me in the village. They can pull the trigger sometimes though. No worthy loot here. Abandoned factory by the road. Farm remnants to the North, blockpost to the South. By the way, militaries has set landmines in some places, watch it. There has been the bridge in the center, but in has been ruined. That`s it, I guess.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_level_10">
        <text>Okay, thanks.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_level_2">
        <text>Tell me more on the army post. </text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_level_21">
        <text>Few dozens of soldiers, they are allowed to shoot on sight. So you better pass them by. When military guys are too worried, start calling help from special forces. Those fellows are really tough. After their visits I have no clients for months. So you better not to disturb them. I know their commander a little. He is a total drunkard. Only thanks to his I`m still here.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_level_3">
        <text>Tell me more about the ruined bridge.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_level_31">
        <text>300-400 meters to the North. You can’t miss it. It was once an expensive bridge, but had been destroyed during the surge. Militaries like to lie in wait for stalkers, returning with the bribe there. So you’d better avoid that embankment, if not crucial.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_level_4">
        <text>Give me the picture on the factory?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_level_41">
        <text>As you cross the road, you’ll notice it. Ruined brick building. Everything that could be stolen, has already been stolen, so the only half-tumbled down core remains. The favorite bandits place. I am not aware if they’re still there, but in any case stay prudent. You’ve still got nothing to take away, but do you really need it? </text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_level_5">
        <text>Give me a wrap-up on the farm? </text>
    </string>
