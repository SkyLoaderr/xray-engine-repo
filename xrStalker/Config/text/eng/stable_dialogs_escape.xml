		<text>Would you tell me more about this place?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_stalker_talk_level_1">
		<text>This is the way to the Zone. If I were you, I wouldn't come too close to the army post or let those soldiers see you: they've got an order to shoot on sight. Further up north there is a broken bridge, but there's a stationary post there, too. Open areas are full of dogs running wild, so that's not a safe place for greenies. Oh, and every now and then mutants drop in.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_stalker_talk_level_10">
		<text>What do I do with the soldiers at the bridge? I've got to get past them somehow.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_stalker_talk_level_11">
		<text>All right, you've got two options. If it's Kuznetsov on duty, keep in mind that he is quite fond of money. Good chance he'll let you through that way. But if you're low on cash or if it's someone else's shift, there is a roundabout way. Follow on the left side of the bridge, along the railway embankment, just make sure that they don't see you! You'll come upon a small tunnel, it goes through the embankment. And another thing: you might also catch a date with some zombies there.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_stalker_talk_level_2">
		<text>What's further up north, beyond the army post?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_stalker_talk_level_21">
		<text>The dump, that’s what's there. A depressing place for sure. In some places there's so much contaminated trash that you just can't walk.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_31">
		<text>Hello, matey. Wolf has already sent word. You got any more questions?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_311">
		<text>Yes. How many bandits in the camp?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_3111">
		<text>About seven or eight people. Two about the gate, two more in the right building near the fire, and another two in the left building - that's where they're keeping Sneaky. Someone usually hands around the yard as well. That's just about it. Shall we say a prayer and go?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_31111">
		<text>Let's begin. Rouse your men.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_31112">
		<text>No. I'll go on my own not to make extra noise.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_311121">
		<text>Well, do as you please. Shout if something is up... Heck, those Rambo wannabes!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_41">
		<text>We went shooting and shoot we did. Wolf will be pleased, methinks.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_51">
		<text>There's more of 'em! Find these bastards and take them down!..</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_61">
		<text>Whoa, man, that was something else! You wiped them out and left nothing for us. I'd never believe it if I didn't see it with my own eyes! Truly hardcore, man, I'll be darned!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_factory_assault_start_71">
		<text>So, where are the piles of enemies you killed? Running your mouth is all you're good for. Get lost!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_fox_hello_dialog_2">
		<text>Sorry, brother, but could you bugger off somewhere else? I'm here to meet someone...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_fox_hello_dialog_21">
		<text>I've got a couple of questions.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_fox_hello_dialog_211">
		<text>OK, ask away.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_fox_hello_dialog_2111">
		<text>What can you tell me about the Zone?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_fox_hello_dialog_21111">
		<text>That's all you wanna know? Take a week off, and then come to see me. Look, my time ain't cheap and I'm kinda busy right now. Here are the basics, and then you're on your own.\nAbout three kilometers North of here, you'll find the Dump. That's the place they used to dump all the radioactive waste from the station. High radiation levels, anomalies all over the place, so there are loads of artifacts to be found there... but not much of value. Just beware of the gangs and don't cross the Debt Patrol. West of the Dump is the former Agroproml R&D Institute. Not much in terms of artifacts there, so you can skip it altogether. And to the East, there's the Black Valley. Who knows... That's a weird place. Seems quiet enough, apart from a bunch of gangsters roaming around. But I got a feeling there's more to it than meets the eye. Oh, and there's the Rostok factory, right beyond the Dump. That's stalker territory. You'll find lots of clued-up folks there, they'll tell you the rest.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_fox_hello_dialog_2113">
		<text>I've changed my mind. Thanks.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_fox_hello_dialog_3">
		<text>Thanks. \nOK, now I'm listening very carefully.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_fox_hello_dialog_31">
		<text>Trader told me you know something about Sharpshooter.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_fox_hello_dialog_311">
		<text>Why is everyone taking such a keen interest interest in him lately? OK, I can't say I've known him personally. We did "communicate" though: my guys took some shots at him once. No one got hurt - it was clear his party had been waiting for someone else, so we parted in peace. Cussed each other out across a ravine and went on our separate ways. Gray, my brother, is now in the hangar at the Dump - I'll dish you his co-ordinates so you two can have a chat. He knows more about Sharpshooter. \nBe careful at the exit – a small gang has settled down in those parts. By the way, I got a few monsters chasing me and it doesn't look like they've given up. Can you help me shoot them down? It's a piece of cake, really.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_fox_hello_dialog_3111">
		<text>Thanks for the info, I appreciate it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_fox_hello_dialog_5">
		<text>A medkit, stalker! Gimme a medkit!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_fox_hello_dialog_55">
		<text>Here you are.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_fox_hello_dialog_56">
		<text>Ain't got a medkit. Sorry.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_fox_hello_dialog_61">
		<text>Hey, mate, you've got me out of a hole twice, and that's not something I like to forget. Take this... that's all I got! And grab some of this ammo for the road, too.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_fox_hello_dialog_611">
		<text>Thank you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_guard_start_dialog_2">
		<text>Wait, Marked One! Right now no one at the camp is going to talk to you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_guard_start_dialog_21">
		<text>Why?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_guard_start_dialog_212">
		<text>What kind of idiot would like to have a chat with a passenger from the "death truck"? First you've got to prove you're ok to deal with.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_guard_start_dialog_2121">
		<text>What "death truck?" I don't remember anything like that… nothing.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_guard_start_dialog_21211">
		<text>Ah, hell knows what it is. But it really is a rotten deal, about as bad as they come... \nWhy am I talking to you about this, anyway! I might be superstitious, but you, Marked One, should really take a hike right now before something goes wrong.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_guard_start_dialog_2122">
		<text>What can I do to make people believe me?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_guard_start_dialog_21221">
		<text>Let the Trader test you while we watch. If you're all right - not trigger-happy and use your head right - then we'll definitely find some common ground, don't you worry.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_guard_start_dialog_22">
		<text>All right, so be it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_guard_start_dialog_3">
		<text>Hello, Marked One. What do you want?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_11">
		<text>What's up, Marked One, how are you doing! We could really use some help.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_111">
		<text>Go on.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_1111">
		<text>I'm Zealot, I'm filling in for the leader here since Wolf left. A few mercenaries came by here yesterday... and they were some tough guys, damnit. Soon as they came, they made some serious demands: you've got one day, like, to clear this camp out - that's gonna be their new base. Tonight they're coming back, and as you probably understand, leisurely chat is not gonna do it this time around.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_11111">
		<text>So, what have you decided?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_111111">
		<text>We're gonna set up an ambush 'cause a direct attack would probably be the end of us. They've got the fighting gear and everything, plus they're trained in tactics like you don't wanna know. And all we've got here are little boys. So, we've decided to just sit tight in these houses, make it look like we're gone. Then we attack when the right moment comes. Fighters like you are just the thing we could use right now. We'd make sure to thank you properly after it's all over, you know we're good for it! So, what do you say, will you help us out?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_1111111">
		<text>I will.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_11111111">
		<text>Let's spend the rest of the time preparing for the fight. Here's the plan. I'll put the most hopeless greenies in houses and basements and tell them not to make a move – otherwise they'll just slaughter our own guys for nothing. You and me and a couple other good guys will take the best positions to have a shot at the area around the fire. As soon as they come close to the fire, we'll let the bullets fly from everywhere! They'll be coming from the bridge... and I think we won't have to wait long.  So, find a good hiding place with a shot, then at my command we all start. Well, see for yourself, it's just that your odds aren't as good in an open area. You decide.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_111111111">
		<text>OK.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_1111112">
		<text>No, I'm not ready yet.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_11111121">
		<text>That's a shame. We could have done some good things with a fighter like you. I guess we'll have to wing it on our own…</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_21">
		<text>Waiting for these pretty boys. I got a feeling they're just around the corner.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_31">
		<text>You're a deadly man, Marked One! I wouldn't want to ever stand in your way.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_311">
		<text>Yep, something like that.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_3111">
		<text>Here, take this for good memories. \nAnd by the way – a million thanks for the help. We did save the youngsters, Marked One.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_41">
		<text>Hey, Marked One, great to see you!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_411">
		<text>Hello to you, too.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_412">
		<text>By the way, where did Wolf go?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_4121">
		<text>Oh, just recently he got a message from a stalker who was passing by, packed his things, grabbed a dynamite box and started off right into the depths of the Zone. At the same time I was just getting back in shape from my Cordon wounds and so he asked me to look after the kids.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_0">
		<text>I've got questions.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_1">
		<text>Go ahead, I'll try to help.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_10">
		<text>Thank you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_2">
		<text>What do you know about the Zone?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_21">
		<text>I know many things. Be more specific.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_211">
		<text>What's in the centre of the Zone?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_2111">
		<text>Ahem, that's a question all right... Two years I've been looking for the answer! But I still haven't found a way to the centre, at least not one where I could come back alive. A couple of times my friends and I tried to break through. I barely made it back, but my friends - well, some did, some didn't... \nYou'll ask why we went there at all. We were chasing our dreams, trying to make them come true.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_21111">
		<text>Do dreams come true?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_211111">
		<text>There is a beautiful story about a Wish-Granting Machine. They say there is a spot in the centre of the Zone where any desires can come true, no matter how bizarre. But you know what? I know for a fact there are a bunch of ways to kick the bucket in the centre of the Zone, but I don't believe in the Wish-Granting Machine. Don't take that risk. I wouldn't.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_212">
		<text>Where did the Zone come from?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_2121">
		<text>In 2006 there was another bang here, so that's how it came about. I know that's not a real answer. Except that very few know the whole truth, if anyone at all.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_213">
		<text>What brought you to the Zone? </text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_2131">
		<text>I used to work in a mine, but they closed it down for lack of profit. I had no money and nothing to look forward to. Then I heard some rumours about the fabulous riches hidden inside the Zone. I had some experience under my belt, so I thought "What the hell?". Can't say I've become rich, but some cash came my way, that's for sure. This is a typical story; most of us got here the same way.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_214">
		<text>What's the most dangerous thing in the Zone?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_2141">
		<text>Difficult to say. There are so many dangers and surprises, you just can't run into all of them. There's more than enough for one person anyway. I got one toe bitten off by a Flesh, my hair is falling out from the radiation, and my half my leg is french-fried because of Scorcher... Scorcher is a real bad one. Another time I happened to come face to face with a bloodsucker – there's a meeting I'd like to forget. So, we can talk all we like, but until you've felt it with your own skin, you'll have no real idea. The only advice I can give is – beware. Everywhere and always.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_3">
		<text>Have you heard about Sharpshooter?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_31">
		<text>I seem to remember he's one of the tough ones. I don't know him personally. Well, I haven't come close to the centre in a while and here all we got is greenies. You should find someone who hangs out deep in the Zone and have a chat with him.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_4">
		<text>What do you know about "death trucks?"</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_info_41">
		<text>I know nothing and that's good enough for me!  \nSorry, I know about your situation. Too much mysticism about it. You spend a month in these parts and you can't help but become superstitious for life, no other choice. Dead people in the trunk, dead people behind the wheel... Who are they, where did they come from and why? I can only hope they didn't rise up from the grave.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_11">
		<text>Hi. Why are you here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_111">
		<text>Hi.\nI need to see Sneaky. Would you know where I could find him?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_1111">
		<text>Sneaky got a raw deal. A little ways from here his group was attacked by some bandits. All he could do was drop me an SOS message. It looked like his pals went under. My guys told me these bastards are now at the old bus depot, the one across the road.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_11111">
		<text>You don't rescue your own people from prison? That's not like friends at all. Or are you too weak to do it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_111111">
		<text>I'd bop you one, but what's the use? It's not that simple. I got too few people, and even those are almost all newbies. I can't take that risk. If we lose this camp, things will get worse for all the regular stalkers out there. And what about yourself? If you aren't too scared, I won't let my pride make me say no to a helping hand. So, will you help me deal with these thugs?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_1111111">
		<text>Think I should do it alone?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_11111111">
		<text>Nah, you stand no chance on your own. My scouts are good soldiers and right now they're right behind those freaks. Together you can make a run for it. What do you think? Or you ain't got the guts?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_111111111">
		<text>I'll try.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_1111111111">
		<text>Way to go! All right, so I gave the guys' co-ordinates. I'll let them know about you right now.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_111111112">
		<text>I got the guts, but I won't go.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_111111121">
		<text>Yeah, like hell you do. Fine, you can drop dead now!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_21">
		<text>So, how is it going?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_211">
		<text>Your guys and I made it a-ok at the bus depot.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_2111">
		<text>That's awesome, mate! Here, take this – that's my personal reward for you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_212">
		<text>I went over the bus depot with a fine-toothed comb. It's all clear now.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_2121">
		<text>Wow! Guys said you gave them a real beating! Here, take this little bit of money... Just a memento, not counting our huge gratitude. Also I got something else for you here...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_21211">

	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_511">
		<text>What can I tell you. There were bandits at the bus depot, so we did some cleaning up. That's about all.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_lager_volk_talk_5111">
		<text>You aren't the bragging kind, are you! Look, since you've dealt with these thugs, I can't just let you go like that...</text>

	<string id="escape_shustryi_start_11">

	<string id="escape_shustryi_start_1111">
		<text>Yeah, I got it... those morons can't even do a proper search. Well, what the heck, take it! After all, you saved my life. It was well hidden, but these thugs can't frisk for shit.</text>

		<text>I didn't keep it down there, don't sweat it. I've worked for Trader for a long time, I can store information safely! By the way, I told the thugs a story about the cache full of artifacts and they ordered one guy to go there. The cache exists, but it's only got one artifact.

	<string id="escape_shustryi_start_3111">

		<text>Good man! You were great help. But, of course a "thank you" won't buy you a piece of bread.

	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_jobs_5">
		<text>Well, here's the deal… A box containing reports made by an expedition that went north deep into the Zone has been taken to the army post. By day it's guarded as if it's filled with pure plutonium but at night they only leave two guards for some reason.</text>

		<text>I'll try.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_jobs_51111">
		<text>I'll get the cash ready - you haven't let me down once, have you Marked One? Just one other thing... keep this thing low profile, eh? If the military get pissed off we're all in for a spot of trouble.</text>

	<string id="escape_trader_jobs_52">
		<text>No, I can't take it on yet.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_jobs_521">
		<text>C'mon man, the post ain't as much as it sounds. A bunch of drunk recruits green as grass with a single NCO…Well, OK but I was really counting on you Marked One…</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_jobs_6">
		<text>Hey Marked One, I've thought about this for a while and I want to offer you something… At the end of the day you want to find Sharpshooter, right?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_jobs_61">
		<text>Let's assume I do.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_jobs_611">
		<text>Well, I found out a bit about this Sharpshooter. First of all, he exists. They say he found the road to the north of the Zone, to untouched fields...a real treasure trove...mmm, yeah... \nSo, here's the deal: I'll help you find him but it ain't no free lunch, you'll have to work for it. On the other hand it's good for both of us - you whack this Sharpshooter of yours and find out what happened to you while I find...err, I mean I make a profit from our little venture too. You game?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_jobs_6111">
		<text>Go on.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_jobs_61111">
		<text>One look at you tells me you're a real man. We need people like you. \nWe're planning a little sortie with a few other traders. We want to go north into the centre of the Zone but something or someone is blocking the way. God knows how this Sharpshooter of yours managed to slip through... There's this place where brains boil! Horrible shit... But anyway, the lads who downed that chopper have been tracking the military nearby. By the looks of things, those army boys have found something in the Institute building and it's likely to be something important. I reckon it's got something to do with the centre of the Zone. Anyway, everything the military found is stored on the second floor and it's guarded pretty well...as you would expect. We really need it though. You follow?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_jobs_611111">
		<text>I think so.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_jobs_6111111">
		<text>As soon as you leave the Institute area with the loot, take it to the Barman. He runs the business in the stalker bar called "100 Roentgen" - it's at the Rostok factory.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_jobs_61111111">
		<text>Gotcha.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_jobs_611111111">
		<text>I'll upload the co-ordinates and the info you need to your PDA. Let me talk you through it: go north through the Dump and then turn west. A couple of kilometres later you'll be at the Institute. By the way, the Dump is full of artifacts but the radiation levels are pretty rough there so you might wanna buy some anti-radiation meds or vodka from me. You don't want to be flashing like a Christmas tree do you...ha-ha? Only joking mate, good luck to you!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_111">
		<text>Well, I've got this little problem, Marked One. Some of my boys were coming back from a mission and disappeared. One of them - Sneaky - was bringing me some info...They disappeared right here somewhere because they missed the bridge. I don't know whether they decided to sell the info to someone else or maybe they're just getting pissed somewhere. Anyway, find Sneaky, dead or alive doesn't really matter, but the important thing is his flash drive. Bring it to me. Sneaky was one of Wolf's lads. You can find Wolf here in the camp. Ask him, he's bound to know something.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_1111">
		<text>Is that it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_171">
		<text>Hey Marked One, wassup?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_181">
		<text>Marked One, what are you doing here? I told you to find Sneaky!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_191">
		<text>So, you paid X18 a visit? Got the documents?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_1911">
		<text>Yeah. Here they are.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_19111">
		<text>Well, well... I see... Now that's interesting, very interesting! I'll need to show it to a friend of mine, a physicist... I bet he'll find it interesting too... Hmm... yep... O! Would you just look at that! I didn't expect this... it's pretty bad, eh... Well, here take these back and give them to the Barman. Oh, and I owe you for your efforts.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_199">
		<text>Stop. Here, take this pistol and ammo. You won't last two seconds in the Zone without a weapon! By the way when you were brought here you had a knife. I took it off you just in case your head wasn't quite working. You look OK now so here it is back.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_1999">
		<text>Thank you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_200">
		<text>So Marked One, any progress on our mutual business?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_3">
		<text>OK, there are two ways that this can go. Either I talk you through a few boring things like I always do with rookies or I can just give you a mission like I do with experienced stalkers. Your choice.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_300">
		<text>Hey Marked One! Good timing, I've got a little job for you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_31">
		<text>Treat me like a rookie, I don't remember shit.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_32">
		<text>Just give me a mission.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_321">
		<text>OK! Well, listen up. There's a field of anomalies nearby - a shitstorm of Meatgrinders. There's an artifact in the field but rookies from the camp are too scared to go after it so it's been there for a week or so. You don't look like no rookie to me, even if you can't remember shit, so I reckon you'll get it no problem. I uploaded the co-ordinates to your PDA as well as full info on the Meatgrinder.\nOh, and one more thing... They're scared of you in the camp so keep you weapon out of sight and don't pick any fights unless you like the taste of rifle butts.\n</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_3211">
		<text>Go on.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_32111">
		<text>That's all for now. Bring me the artifact and we'll consider that you've partially paid me for saving you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_321111">
		<text>OK, I'll try.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_4">
		<text>Hey, Marked One. Glad to see you alive.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_5">
		<text>Greetings, Marked One! Did you manage?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_51">
		<text>I did. Here's the artifact.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_511">
		<text>Great, Marked One. One more little favour and we're even. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_5111">
		<text>What favour?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_52">
		<text>The situation has become clear.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_52111">
		<text>Where's the flash drive with the info?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_521111">
		<text>Here it is.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_5211111">
		<text>Great.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_521112">
		<text>I don't have it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_5211121">
		<text>That's a pity, Marked One, a real pity. We can't talk business until you bring it to me…</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_521211">
		<text>Here, take it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_5212111">
		<text>Good…We'll consider that you passed the test. I'd suggest you avoid going to the rookie camp.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_56">
		<text>Nothing yet.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_571">
		<text>So, did you bring the artifact?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_5711">
		<text>Not yet.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_57111">
		<text>Well, until you bring it we've got nothing to talk about. Got it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_6">
		<text>Marked One, I've told you everything already. Get outta here!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_661">
		<text>So Marked One, any news?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_0">
		<text>I need answers to a few questions.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_1">
		<text>Ask away but I don’t know everything. I sit here all day while life goes on outside, in the Zone. I can tell you about the Zone in general and a little about the nearby areas where I've been myself.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_100">
		<text>Tell me about the Zone in general.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_101">
		<text>Ask away.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_2">
		<text>What does the army do in the Zone?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_21">
		<text>They guard and protect, what else? No one really knows whether they're guarding the Zone or protecting the rest of the world from it. Sometimes they send whole expeditions here to look for something... \nBut I'll tell you something: the army doesn't respect the Zone and it doesn't like the army either so from time to time they take body bags away. What else is there? Well, they look down at everyone and think they're gods or something. They have no respect for stalker rules and won't ever help you even if you're dying right in front of them. They'll gladly shoot you themselves tho', they don't get reprimanded for that... I've got a few contacts among them...you know, people always need vodka and...umm, magazines, right? Don't annoy them - they'll end you for nothing.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_3">
		<text>Tell me about the Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_31">
		<text>The Zone... You see, it's not just a circle a some odd kilometres in diameter with a nuclear plant in the centre. It's something bizarre. Really bizarre. I doubt anyone in our world could give you a straight answer. I feel the Zone isn't even part of this world. It's a separate, detached world – weird and dangerous... and bloody attractive, too. And you know why? Because with a little luck anyone can get rich quickly. And the closer you come to the centre of the Zone, the higher you will climb on the money ladder.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_311">
		<text>What's so dangerous about this "separate world"?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_3111">
		<text>Hrm... Not a whole lot, except you can croak any second and not know what hit you. A dumb zold's bullet isn't half the trouble, although they've pulled in a lot of military in here. Getting shot is basically the most painless kind of death in the Zone. Anomalies – now that's something for you... To die because of an anomaly is a terrible thing indeed. Even mutants try to keep away from them. By the way, mutants, these "children of the Zone," are another kind of trouble, so don't go anywhere unarmed. And anyway, to learn about the other dangers, just ask other stalkers.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_312">
		<text>How can I get rich in here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_3121">
		<text>Gee, mate, did you get hit over the head or something? You don't remember?!\nArtifacts –  that's the most important thing here. All sorts of weird toys that come from the Zone are worth a fortune in the Main Land. Artifacts are more precious than gold, diamonds or pure plutonium. Why? Because no jewelry in the world can give you the supernatural powers that these artifacts possess. Just imagine: you can hang a little gadget on your belt that makes bullets swerve by and never hit you! What else? Well, you can find some small change even right here next to us. For the most valuable pieces though you'll have to get closer to the centre.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_313">
		<text>Does anyone know what's happening in the centre of the Zone?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_3131">
		<text>Everyone tells a different story. You'll hear a bunch of fairy tales... except I don't believe all that otherworldly nonsense. The one thing I do believe is that the centre of the Zone contains a lot of valuable artifacts. Only I haven't met anyone who went there and managed to come back alive.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_4">
		<text>Do you know what happened to me?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_41">
		<text>What kind of question is that, mate? You see, that's some murky business... \nThey found you in a "death truck," that's a... a kind of corpse carrier, get it? These trucks come in from the centre of the Zone once in a while, loaded with bodies. No one really knows where they are headed. So, one of these trucks crashed into something and you were found nearby. This is the most amazing thing of all. We've found broken-down corpse carriers before, but no one ever came out of them alive. I'm sorry, bro, that's all I can help you with. The rest you'll have to figure out yourself.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_5">
		<text>Who is Sharpshooter?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_51">
		<text>Yeah, there seems to be a stalker by that name. Rumours say he's one of the few who went to the centre of the Zone and made it back. Still, we got so many of these legendary stories about stalker heroes that I can't really guarantee anything. At any rate, I've never dealt with him personally – it seems he has his own trading channels. In general, just ask the folks here in the Zone and you'll be sure to learn a lot more.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_6">
		<text>Who is this Ghost stalker?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_61">
		<text>Heh, that's another local legend. \nWe haven't had any news from him in a long while. I suppose he perished somewhere deep in the Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_99">
		<text>What's happening in this neighbourhood?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_999">
		<text>Huh! This is the entrance to the Zone, a sort of lobby. We've got an army cordon here. It's relatively quiet, with the exception of some army guys who like to have some fun, go on shakedown runs. Experienced stalkers don't come by very often, so it's mostly greenies. Some settle here for good, yeah... A little ways from here there's a ranch made into a greenie camp. Watch yourself though, they aren't afraid to pull the trigger if need be. \nWhat else? You won't make any huge profits here, that's for sure. There's a deserted factory across the road. To the north, behind the railroad embankment there are some ruins of a farm. An army post lies to the south of here. And beware: the military left some mines in the ground. Also, there used to be a bridge in the centre, but it went down somehow. That's about it, really.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_9991">
		<text>Tell me more about the army post.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="escape_trader_talk_info_99911">
		<text>The few soldiers that are there have been ordered to shoot on sight, so you'd better walk around it and not show your ass off.

		<text>That's just a couple of minutes to the north of here – you'll see it right away. There used to be a bridge over the road, but then it just collapsed during one of the eruptions. The army lads built a post there and don't let anyone through... but if you grease the right palm, you'll pass with no problems. In general, you don't want to show off there too much, unless you're badly wounded or got a heavy load on you.</text>
