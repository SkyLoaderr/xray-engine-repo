        <text>This is the road inside the Zone. Trader can be found in the cellar beyond the village near the army post. I don’t advise you to poke your nose in the army \npost, cos soldiers are directed to fire on sight… Killing soldiers isn’t allowed, only if worst comes to worst, trader will pay off on his own and he won’t be \nsatisfied with that. Packs of blind dogs on the plains, perilously for the newbies. Mutants visit it now and then.</text>

    <string id="esc_stalker_talk_level_11">
        <text>There is one more variant. Walk right from the bridge along the railroad mound. The point is to watch out for not being detected. There you will see a small \ntunnel, which lies under the mound. Militaries know about it. But be careful, zombies like that location.</text>

    <string id="escape_fox_flame_dialog_21">
        <text>Such a story may take a few days to tell, and my time costs a lot. Can only give you a piece of advice. "Dump" – located 3 kilometers to the North from where \nI stand, where all the radioactive trash had been taken to from stations in 86th. Heavy radiation, host of anomalies, and ultimately – abundance of artifacts, \nadmittedly not valuable. Beware of the bandits and try not to swear at “Duty” patrols. Scientific research institute “Agroprom” is to the west from the “Dump”. \nRegion is quite poor regarding the artifacts, so I don’t go there often. “Dark Valley” to the east. Sort of weird place. Like it’s rather quiet in there, but bandits \nand stuff can now and then be met. Yet I sense that not everything is so simple there as it seems. Further beyond the Dump is “Rostok” factory territory – \nstalkership heart. Besides many experienced guys you can come across with.</text>

    <string id="escape_fox_flame_dialog_3">
        <text>The Dealer said you may know something about the Gunslinger.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_fox_flame_dialog_31">
        <text>Many have been interested in him recently. Truthfully I don’t know him personally. But I do have err.. “contact” experience. His grouping has once fired upon \nmy boys. No one was hurt – they’ve been probably waiting for the other ones, thus I consider it to me a misunderstanding. Fouled each other over the ravine \nand left. O, by the way, Grey is waiting for me at the garage at the Dump, I’ll send you the coordinates, chat with him. He knows a lot more.</text>

        <text>Hi, Branded One. What do you need?</text>

    <string id="escape_lager_hlam_hello_0">
        <text>Greetings. Wish to sell something?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_hlam_talk_people_0">
        <text>You are familiar with majority here. What has this crowd gathered here for?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_hlam_talk_people_1">
        <text>Yeah, it’s hard to say unambiguously, from doctors of science to laid-back bandits. Everyone receives the task to its wit. Militaries usually guard the \nperimeter, rarely entering the Zone. Bandits are settled on the stalkers’ paths. May bereave of bribe or even life. Scientists are set somewhere deep inside it, \nsearching for the bloody truth, idiots! There are several stalkers’ clans, but that’s another matter. People here in the camp are rather quiet and peaceful this is \nunderstood – freshly, anxious newbies. Unless the “Wolf” is familiar in here. This one has seen a lot, but to my mind he’s a bit freaky with stalkership and all, \nhe wants to cut off.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_hlam_talk_people_10">
        <text>Thanks.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_hlam_talk_people_2">
        <text>You’ve mentioned some stalkers’ clans. Can you give more specified information?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_hlam_talk_people_21">
        <text>You see, it’s really hard to survive in the Zone by yourself. So such clans are gathering here and there. Some for convictions, some for money. But there are \nlots of free stalkers, as I am. Everyone is free to chose: join someone or act alone on own hazard and fear. Concerning factions I can give roundup on the \n“Duty”, “Mercenaries” and “Monolith”</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_hlam_talk_people_3">
        <text>Concerning the bandits. Why not to perish them once and for all? Admittedly everyone has weapons.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_hlam_talk_people_31">
        <text>Well, generally we’re trying to do that. But if ones are shot, another come to the Zone.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_hlam_talk_people_4">
        <text>Tell me about the “Duty” faction.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_hlam_talk_people_41">
        <text>These consider themselves to be Zone hags. They think that the Zone is the malignant growth on the Earth body, and going to clear the Earth from the Zone \nand its inhabitants, haven’t yet decided how indeed. Thus shot all the mutants without distinction.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_hlam_talk_people_5">
        <text>Tell me about the “Mercanaries” faction.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_hlam_talk_people_51">
        <text>Generally those have gathered there are not satisfied by the war in the “outer world”. Extreme Zone conditions shooting enthusiasts. Ready to fulfil any, \neven the most dirty work. Well equipped, by occidental weapons in majority.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_hlam_talk_people_6">
        <text>Tell me about the “Monolith” faction.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_hlam_talk_people_61">
        <text>Why they’re kind of strange ones. Don’t gather artifacts. Don’t make any liaisons. Don’t trade. Believe in some crap like aliens and evolutional module inside the \ncenter of the zone, which shall change the civilization on the earth for good. But these are rumors. I haven’t had personal contacts with them.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_hlam_talk_people_611">
        <text>And do you yourself believe in something? What’s in the center of Zone?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_hlam_talk_people_6111">
        <text>I believe that even the most intimate dreams are granted in the center of the Zone. But I don’t have a clue what’s in there. I trust that some day I will be able to \nmake it there.</text>

        <text>Everyone needs Branded One's help. I've become so popular and famous that I'll have to hide from those who wish to get my autograph, and which is typical, \ntogether with my head. But what was I talking about. What mess do I have to make now?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_leader_give_quest_1">
        <text>I'm called Fan, I've been left as the chief here after wolf. Yesterday several men came here from "mercenaries" group... Total scoundrels... Came here and \npressed us, like we've got one day term to leave this camp... Like it's their property and that's it... Today they must come again. But today, as you understand, \nwe won't leave it for talks.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_leader_give_quest_2">
        <text>And what have you decided to do?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_leader_give_quest_22">
        <text>We've decided to create an ambush for them. I doubt that we can resist them in frontal combat. They are well-equipped... while we've got only boys here... \nGenerally speaking, we've decided to hide at the houses, pretending that the camp is going to be abandoned, then having seized the right moment attack. So, \na good combatant, as yourself, is needed indeed.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_leader_give_quest_221">
        <text>This freaks me out, buddy. We don't know who's behind the, or even who they really are. Nope, I'm not playing games like these.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_leader_give_quest_2212">
        <text>Pity. Such a fighter like you are would make a significant advantage to our course. Well, it seems that we'll have to cope with our own efforts.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_leader_give_quest_222">
        <text>Mercenaries, you say... Well, we'll make a bloody bath for them. We don't let any touhg jerks to command here. So you are making yourself as a hero only for \nmoney, is that right?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_leader_give_quest_2222">
        <text>Sure! We'll settle accounts... I propose to spend the time remaining to prepare for battle. Here goes the plan... The very novices will be sent to houses, with \nthe order not to poke out their noses... Or they can be knocked out in a jiffy... You and I, and several more new guys, who are more persistent, will fill the \nplaces around the campfire to provide a dense firing. We'll let them closer to the campfire and on my command we'll strike them out.... They'll come from the \ndirection of the bridge.. I think soon enough... So search for the place to cover with a open view on the campfire and we will begin with my command... \nHowever, you can surely go towards them, but I doubt that you've got any chances in open combat... So it's up to you to decide.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_leader_hello_11">
        <text>Listen, Branded One, you are very apropos here. I need your help.</text>

        <text>What’s inside the Zone?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_volk_info_2111">
        <text>This is the very question, which I wanted to find the answer to during the last two years. But the safe path to the center of the Zone hasn’t been found yet. \nSeveral times I tried to break through with my friends. I have hardly made it to return, my friends haven’t. If you ask how we got there, I’ll tell ya that we were \nseeking for the dream, for the wish master.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_volk_info_21111">
        <text>Why do you think that the dreams are to come true there?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_volk_info_211111">
        <text>There is a stalkers’ legend of the “wish master”. A place located in the center of the Zone, where all, even the most incredible, wishes come true. But you \nknow what I’ll tell ya, I do know that there is the mere death in the center of the Zone, and that “master” is noteworthy. So, don’t run risks in vain.</text>

    <string id="escape_lager_volk_info_2121">
        <text>Well, something boomed in 2006. Then it came. I know that this is barely an answer, but believe me that the truth is clear to very few.</text>

        <text>What has led you inside the Zone?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_volk_info_2131">
        <text>Our unprofitable mine has been closed in 2008. Insufficient money. Then the rumors came about the Zone to give a chance to grow rich. I had no lack of army \nexperience, so I ventured to do it. I can’t say that I an extremely rich now, but I’ve got a fair bit of brass behind my back. Typical story, as well as many \nothers.</text>

    <string id="escape_lager_volk_info_214">
        <text>What’s the most dangerous in the Zone?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_volk_info_2141">
        <text>Well, it’s hard to say. There are so many things still dangerous and unknown that I’ve hardly seen the whole enchilada. My body is the vivid example of the \nZone’s dangers: bit off toe, thinned hair over the radiation, right hip burnt in “Zharka”, bloody thing by the way. Anomaly which isn’t standing on the same \nplace, but flying. Had a face to face contact with the bloodsucker once. I dread even recollecting it. Basically we can talk it through and through, but if you \nhaven’t felt it on your skin – you won’t understand. Just one advice – be careful.</text>

        <text>Kind of tough stalker to my mind. Not really familiar with him. However I’ve been wandering at the center of the Zone too long ago, and here to the \nboundsthere are quite a lot of newbies. You ought to talk to somebody working in the depth of the Zone.</text>

        <text>I don’t know anything at all. Sorry, I see that you’re from there. But it’s too mystified. But working a bit in the Zone makes you superstitious indeed. Corpses in \nthe body, dead men at the wheels… Who they are? Where have they come from… Hope not from the other side.</text>

    <string id="escape_lager_volk_job_1">
        <text>Could be well worth making, yeah. However you stand no chances alone. Listen here. Nearby the factory under the bridge my scouts keep an eye on these \nrascals. Go to see them and tell that I sent you as reinforcements for the factory assault. Should they not believe, send my "greetings from hell". It's the \npassword.</text>

    <string id="escape_lager_volk_job_111">
        <text>Firstly, the guys will have it safer to walk around. Secondly, I was expecting a dynamite crate to be delivered, but due to bandits it was never delivered. This \ncrate I promised to serious people, so the whole situation didn't look well at all. If you deliver it to me, I'll repay.</text>

    <string id="escape_trader_blokpost_case_1">
        <text>Yes, again it's connected with the militaries. You're the specialist in such cases. He-he... Can you satisfy me and my curiosity?</text>

        <text>Well, shoot it, what are the secrets you're keeping.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_blokpost_case_111">
        <text>Well, the business is... Someone has delivered to the army post a case from the depth of the Zone with the report on one of the military expeditions, which \nwas studying the North bounds... And this case is guarded as if it has got piles of plutonium in it. But at night there are one or maximum two guardsmen left. \nWhile you're very famous ninja guy.

    <string id="escape_trader_blokpost_case_11111">
        <text>Great, I'll be waiting. You haven't ever let me down. But, listen, don't make any noise there, because we'll have to search for a new place to live if the \nmilitaries take an offence.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_blokpost_case_1112">
        <text>Sidorovich, you have lost your mind - assault the army post! I'll better spit upon Voronin's face personally, if I were tired of living.</text>

        <text>Okay, give them to Barkeep... Listen, here is the business. Visit the camp of the novices, they've got a huge problem there. They seem to be rushed by \nsomeone. And after you help them - come to me, and I will have a job for you.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_done_blockpost_box_0">

        <text>Well done, thanks a lot. Not that you can be stuffed with the mere “thanks”. Weeell, 3000, no let it be 2000 rubles and we’re done. By the way, as soon as \nmilitaries discover the loss, here will be a big mess. So, be off like a shot.</text>

        <text>Branded One... My messengers are returning from raid. I don't want to see them here - they may have brought somebody on the tail.

    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_jobs_10">
        <text>This is what's happening. Nearby here, at the factory bandits have encamped. And they go pinching stalkers who go to me with artefacts, so you understand how \ndetrimental it is for sales. And not only for me. Here in the camp they are disliked similarly. So you can join forces to cleanse the Cordon from these bastards. \nNaturally, I'd owe you.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_jobs_104">
        <text>So, it is. There are bandits, settled nearby at the factory. And they used to pinch stalkers from time to time, who are coming with artifacts to me, which as \nyou understand prevents the whole trading process. And not only mine. The camp is also not satisfied with them. But as you've spoiled with Tolik, Wolf won't \nhelp you. I think, that if you deal with the bandits, I'll convince them to change anger to mercy. But, what a heck, you really have to do your best.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_jobs_105">
        <text>Well, awright, no other chances. I'll go, I think.</text>

        <text>Wolf, leader of novices. Come to him, he'll provide you, feasible help.</text>

    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_jobs_2">
        <text>All as usual. First of all I need artifacts. I pay usual price not more, not less.\n Sometimes I need specail people for special work. Moreover I sometimes have the special orders for certain artifacts.</text>

        <text>Branded One I've though a bit and I want to offer you something... You mainly have to look for your Gunslinger. Is that right?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_jobs_61">
        <text>Let's assume it's right.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_jobs_611">
        <text>Well, I've found out something on the Gunslinger. There is such stalker. He's said to have found the road to the North of the Zone. The places there are \nuntouched... the Klondike of artifacts... well... So, I'll help you to find him... but... as you understand not for free. You'll have to work it off... But, eventually, \nboth of us will be satisfied - you'll kill your Gunslinger guy, and will learn about your past... And I will learn... I mean - I'll have my own benefit from the \ncooperation... Hehe.. Well, what will you say? Deal?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_jobs_6111">
        <text>Well... You're very likely to make my life easier... Deal.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_jobs_61111">
        <text>Good... Now listen... You're a serious minded guy... I can see that... And I, that is to say we, need such people - we, together with the other traders, are \ncarrying out an investigation. The aim - is to discover the path to North to the center of the Zone. But closer to the center there is the place which prevents \npassing... I don't give a hell how your Gunslinger made it through... You see, there is a place where your brains get boiled out. Omnious place... Hm.. Well, \ncloser to the point... Those guys who have been smited down by the copter, watched for the militaries nearby for me. And to all appearances, the militaries \nfrom the former Agroprom have found something. Something very momentous. I'm sure that it's somehow pertained to the center of the Zone. So, everything \nthat was found by militaries is kept on the second floor of the Institute. And we do need it. Got it, where I am driving at?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_jobs_611111">
        <text>Well, I understood that.. But I'm merely interesting what if they've discovered a plant weighting 10 tons there? What then?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_jobs_6111111">
        <text>No... The matter concerns the small white sack-bag. Speaking in short we pay a lot. That's because it won't be easy to steal it from the stare of SBU. They are \ntough fighters. Act very deliberately. Maybe you could sneak there at night. Will you do this?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_jobs_61111111">
        <text>Let's live and see....</text>

        <text>If you obtain a grip-sack, bring it to me - and then take it to Barkeep. He's in charge of the business in stalkers' bar "100 Rontgen", which is on the territory of \nformer Rostok factory. Clear?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_jobs_6111111111">
        <text>Details would not be out of the place.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_jobs_61111111111">
        <text>Yes, sure... Coordinates and the concomitant information will be copied to PDA. Generally speaking, go to the North through the Garbage, then turn \nwestwards, and in a couple of kilometers you'll get to the Agroprom. Go mushroom-kicking the artifacts at the Garbage, but consider the counter. I advice to \nbuy antirad and some vodka from me. You don't need to shine brightly at nights because of the radiation, hehe. Well, good luck.</text>

        <text>Can you get it... you'll perish here in the Zone, and if not than you'll definitely have troubles with finding your past... while I have connections, informers... \nbesides, I'm not offering you to work for me for free, but for fair money... so, give up your hesitations - you have the mere profit.

    <string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_2">
        <text>To make it short, Branded One, I’ve saved you and I won’t play dignified. Conduct some tasks for me and we’re done. Besides we’ll see how fast will your \nhead restore from amnesia, and I’ll try to find about your case. A hell knows why do you need that Gunslinger, I don’t care of the outside problems.

    <string id="escape_trader_start_dialog_321">
        <text>Î! That’s how we do that. Listen then: \n There is the “Mincer” anomaly field nearby. And the artifact in the center. Local novices from the camp are afraid to poke in there. Well it’s scattered \nsomewhere there for about a week. It’s written all over your face that you’re not a newbie, although you remember nothing. So even in such condition you’ll \nmanage to bag it. Okay. Get to the job. I’ve sent the coordinates of that place to your PDA along with the information on the Mincer and its artifacts.</text>

    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_0">
        <text>I need answers to several questions.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_1">
        <text>Shoot, but I know few. You see, I’m stuck here for the eternity, while the real life is outside in the Zone.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_10">
        <text>Thanks for the information.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_2">
        <text>What are the militaries doing in the Zone?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_21">
        <text>Military guard it, what else can they do. The one thing I don’t get is whether they protect outside world form the Zone, or Zone from the outside world. Yep, I \nstill don`t get it. Military expeditions sometimes come here. Must be searching for something. But I tell you, military men do not respect the Zone, and Zone \npays back the same. Lots of then found they dead end here. Yep, dead.\nWhat, tell more? Well, those guys look down on us all, like some kind of supreme beings. Don`t give a damn about stalker laws, never help, even in the worst \npossible situation. No, lying, they can soot you, but not out of pity. Its just runs in their blood: Shoot first, think later. But I and they deal pretty well. Vodka, men \nmagazines, in exchange for my private peace. So I advise you not to bother them in vain.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_3">
        <text>Tell me about the Zone.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_31">
        <text>Zone... is not just a peace of territory 40 kilometers in diameter, with its center near the nuclear plant. Zone is really strange being. I don`t think there is a \nperson in this world who can give you a definite answer on your question. Because Zone is something not from this reality. I think it`s another world. \nDangerous, strange, but, damn, it`s attractive. It`s like Eldorado, there even the most miserable bum can became very, very rich. And the deeper you go into \nthe Zone, the closer you come to your fortune.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_311">
        <text>And what’s so dangerous in this “other world”?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_3111">
        <text>He, he. Nothing dangerous, besides that you can die any second. And not from the bullet of stupid military, by the way there are a lot of this guys lately. Must \nalso tell, that be killed with a shot is the nicest death here. Really nice, compared with dying in anomaly - invisible death is the scariest one. Even mutants try \nto avoid them. Mutants, yes, “children” of the Zone. \nNasty creatures, tell ya. So you better don`t go to the Zone without a gun. And talk to stalkers, they are good advisers as for the Zone.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_312">
        <text>Rich? I would like to know more about getting rich...</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_3121">
        <text>Dude, don`t tell me you know nothing about artifacts. They are the source of your wealth. People outside pay good dough for these souvenirs form the Zone. \nThey are more dear then gold and diamonds. Because no gold can draw aside bullet that heads right into your belly. And artifacts do this, and many other \nfunny and useful things. You can get most common ones even here, but to find a treasure, you`ll have to go to heart the Zone.</text>

    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_313">
        <text>And what lies there, in the heart of the Zone?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_3131">
        <text>People tell a lot, if interested, ask other stalkers. But I don`t believe in this mystic staff. I do believe that in the center of the Zone lies an Eldorado, a place rich \nin artifacts. But I met no people who could either confirm, or deny it.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_4">
        <text>Any ideas of what happened to me?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_41">
        <text>Son, you ask hell of questions. Everything is shady about it. You where found in the death truck - vehicles loaded with corpses sometimes appear from the \ncenter of the Zone. Where they head to, no one know. You truck crashed – bad luck, but you stayed alive. This is the most intriguing fact to me. Stalkers \noften find broken death trucks, but never found any survivals. Sorry, have nothing more to tell. You`ll have to figure it out yourself.</text>

    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_5">
        <text>Who is Gunslinger? You know this guy?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_51">
        <text>I think I heard of this stalker. Rumors tell he is one of few, who got to the center of Zone. Well, there are a lot of legends about “stalker who made it to the \ncenter and back”. So, can`t guaranty the story is true, I personally had no business with him. Maybe he works with other dealers. Want to find him, ask \nstalkers, maybe some of them will tell you a way.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_6">
        <text>Ghost stalker, heard of him?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_61">
        <text>Its another legendary man. Not heard about him for a long time. He must have died somewhere deep in the Zone.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_level_0">
        <text>Tell me about this place.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_level_1">
        <text>Suburbs of the Zone, military cordon. In general it is usually calm and quite here, just military guys have fun sometimes. Stalkers only pass by, only freshmen linger \non, and sometimes forever, hehe. There is the novices’ camp set nearby me in the village. They can pull the trigger sometimes though. No worthy loot here. \nAbandoned factory by the road. Farm remnants to the North, blockpost to the South. By the way, militaries has set landmines in some places, watch it. There \nhas been the bridge in the center, but in has been ruined. That`s it, I guess.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_level_10">
        <text>Okay, thanks.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_level_2">
        <text>Tell me more on the army post.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_level_21">
        <text>Few dozens of soldiers, they are allowed to shoot on sight. So you better pass them by. When military guys are too worried, start calling help from special \nforces. Those fellows are really tough. After their visits I have no clients for months. So you better not to disturb them. I know their commander a little. He is a \ntotal drunkard. Only thanks to his I`m still here.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_level_3">
        <text>Tell me more about the ruined bridge.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_level_31">
        <text>300-400 meters to the North. You can’t miss it. It was once an expensive bridge, but had been destroyed during the surge. Militaries like to lie in wait for \nstalkers, returning with the bribe there. So you’d better avoid that embankment, if not crucial.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_level_4">
        <text>Give me the picture on the factory?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_level_41">
        <text>As you cross the road, you’ll notice it. Ruined brick building. Everything that could be stolen, has already been stolen, so the only half-tumbled down core \nremains. The favorite bandits place. I am not aware if they’re still there, but in any case stay prudent. You’ve still got nothing to take away, but do you really \nneed it?</text>

    <string id="escape_trader_talk_level_5">
        <text>Give me a wrap-up on the farm?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_level_51">
        <text>What a boring one you are. Simple farm as every other one. Pigs pegged out even before the Perestroika.</text>

        <text>Great... Let's assume that you've passed the check-up. I'll tell to the camp of novices that you're kind of an adequate one.

Now I see that you're pretty okay, and I return it to you. \nBut I warn you fairly, you'd better buy something more serious. You won't do much with a single knife.</text>

        <text>Yes, it was you, who have laid hands here. You're a jerk, Branded One. Why did you have to kill them? Okay, it's not my trouble. One of them had to have a \nflash-drive with the information. Where is it?</text>

Now I see that you're okay, but you'll die \ninstantly without weapons, so I give it to you. But I warn you, one knife isn't enough for everything.
