		<text>So, your first fight? Your opponent is a piece of meat just like you. He's here because of debts and he only has two options: to come out and fight or to land himself in the nearest anomaly. He's gonna fight like a cornered animal. Equipment for today... lemme think... OK! Why don't you two use Makarovs...two clips each should be plenty. Either you kick his arse or we feed you to the dogs - not much of a choice. Go on now.</text>

		<text>You last fight didn't mean shit. You're still the same piece of meat you were before and no self-respecting person will bet a single mag on you. If you wanna earn some proper cash you're gonna have to make a few more appearances in the arena. Your new opponent also got through the first round and his fight was a lot harder than yours. I don't like him, to be honest - he kills too quickly and the crowd doesn't like that. So, go and show us what you can do! The stakes will increase after this fight - all you gotta do is stay alive. Move it!</text>

		<text>Well, well... You're not as much of a pussy as you first seemed. Now it's time to test you out in a real fight. You're up against two guys. The first one's called Swede and I don't remember the second one's name. They were paired up intentionally as they hate each other's guts so don't worry about them working as a team - they're more likely to shoot each other. Today is rifle day so don't let them get too close or we'll have to pick you up piece by piece. The odds are 10:1 so if you win you'll make a fair amount. Off you go!</text>

		<text>Well, now I can safely say that you're a fighter, a real fighter. Now it's time for a team fight. You get to fight with two rookies on your side. They haven't fought yet but they're brothers, so I had to put them into a team fight. I wouldn't expect any real help from them if I were you. You're fighting an experienced team, they're contenders for the final this season. A dangerous lot. They use different weapons but one has an automatic shotgun - be very careful with him. Good luck, mate... you're gonna need it.</text>

		<text>You've got a special fight today. Even the army has heard about you! Don't be surprised, they fight here too - there's even a general in the crowd. These guys are from the Spetsnaz or from OMON. They're well armed and their armor is good as you'd expect. Don't worry though, I ain't gonna leave you out in the rain, either. You'll get a vest used by Freedom - it's light so it won't slow you down. Go on, show them that stalkers ain't no whipping boys. Good luck!</text>

		<text>Time for you to show what you can do. Duty captured a group of bandits that had been causing problems for stalkers near Rostok. Duty took 'em at night so most of the bandits were taken alive. They were all gonna be executed anyway so I convinced Duty to give them a chance. If any of them survive, they'll go in the can outside the Zone, which is better than dying here. They're not well-armed - just a few pistols and sawn-offs - but there's six of them so watch yourself. Go on now!</text>

There will be a surprise that I can't tell you about too... Here's my advice: be prepared, it's gonna be tough. The winner makes it through to the final. Fight to the death, go!</text>

		<text>Great, the situation is becoming clearer. Just as I thought, the Burner is man-made - it's a Kaimanov emitter, whatever that is, and they made parts for it at X18. Now we need to find out how we can avoid being affected by it. There's a reference here to some lab designated as X16 where they sent the finished units. It says here that X16 is located in the former production facility by Lake Yantar. The scientists have set up a mobile lab there, I'm sure they can tell us more.</text>

		<text>This legend is about the Monolith, which may be what caused the Zone to appear. When the Zone exploded in 2006, they evacuated people living near it and the Zone itself was cordoned off by the Army. Everyone was panicking, nobody knows what was going on, the Zone was expanding and the field labs couldn't do anything! Loads of people died there. Everyone was afraid of the radiation which could affect half of Europe. After a few years had passed, some brave guys like you, calling themselves stalkers, appeared. They started to sneak past army cordons believing that there are things in the Zone that would make them rich. Bit by bit, they brought out weird things, artifacts and there was a lot of demand for them. Scientists went after them like crazy. They paid big money for just one trinket back then, not like now.</text>

		<text>After a while, the first tales and legends about what's deep inside the Zone by the nuclear power plant started to circulate. It was also then that one of the veterans told us the story of a Monolith that supposedly grants your wishes.

		<text>When the Zone had just appeared many people were trapped inside and cut off from the outside world. Most of them died pretty quickly but there were a few lucky survivors who tried to do something about it. One of these survivors found himself by the station and noticed some strange light inside. With no way back he decided to try to get closer. He saw the broken roof of the sarcophagus and the light coming out through it. He climbed up the wall and looked inside. Among the debris of metal and molten concrete there lay a massive black rock. It was the Monolith. The stalker managed to shake off the "spell" and realised that he had climbed very close to the sarcophagus, which was highly radioactive. He was scared to death but through the fear he could sense the Monolith calling to him. The Monolith called to him and he came to see strange, unbelievable things about the Monolith inside his head...</text>

		<text>Sure, no problem! Freedom is one of the oldest groups in the Zone and the only one that openly opposes government troops and research teams. Its founders are dead - they were killed during a big bloodbath after the army dropped a large assault force in the Zone but the ability to control the Zone from outside was destroyed at the same time. There is some evidence to suggest that the first Zone was used as a secret army weapons' testing site . If that's true, they must have used some powerful shit.\nAnyway, what was I saying...? Oh yeah, Freedom is the only group that is trying to stop the government from gaining control over the testing site again. God knows what will happen if they start testing their shit again, so Freedom is trying to hold out at all costs.</text>

		<text>Useful to a rookie? Well, listen up. To the North, not far from the Brain Burner, Freedom have set up their HQ in an old military base. They're notorious nihilists, anarchists and criminals - freedom fighters, freaking Che Guevaras all of them. All they do is sabotage research groups, attack army units and constantly skirmish with Duty. These skirmishes are now spilling over into a small-scale war for survival. Let me give you some advice: never get involved with them. They'll only accept you if you're totally crazy and there's a reward on your head. Ha-ha-ha. Can you believe that?</text>

		<text>Well, there used to be this group led by Hawkeye. There were all sorts of legends about it going around the Zone...good and bad, but few people really knew the truth. The truth is that they wanted to deal with the Zone, find out what created it. That's why military stalkers were after them but they didn't know where to look. The government didn't want normal stalkers to know things they shouldn't have known. One day Hawkeye found something really important and made a move towards the center of the Zone with some of his boys. Half of the group died on the way but the rest made it through... What happened to them there - no one knows. Looks like they've copped it. The other group members were caught and killed off... I don't think there are any of them left now. Sad story, eh?</text>

We were half-way through the sector, when the Burner suddenly switched on again. Spotty passed out straight away and fell down the hillside. I panicked and said that we should leave everything and go back. Hunchback managed to pull himself together and said that we gotta get Spotty out... I said "You're an idiot, don't you wanna live? It's over for him, how are we gonna carry him all the way back?" Just as he managed to convince me and started to climb down to get Spotty... another wave came.

		<text>Traders say that there's a real treasure trove of artifacts in the center of the Zone, so anyone who makes it through will make enough money for two lifetimes. Personally, I think there's more to this. Obviously the traders think about their own interests, but there are strange rumours going around. Apparently, there's something better than artifacts there - something that ain't from this world, something alien or from another dimension altogether! They call it the Wish-granting machine. I heard a legend about a stalker who made it through. Only every time someone makes a wish the Zone grows and nobody who gets there uses his wish to make it disappear.

If you want to trade, talk, get a mission or find out the latest news it's the place to go. There's also the Arena where you can fight and make some cash. Duty's base is not far from the Arena. If you want to join Duty go straight over there - they'll tell you who to speak to. Oh, by the way, all of this area is protected by Duty so behave and keep your weapons holstered.

		<text>What do you want to know?</text>

	<string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_11">
		<text>Who are you and how did you end up here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_111">
		<text>My name is Kruglov. I am a professor of biology, I study the Zone. Yesterday, for example, I found an animal of particular interest - Antropomorphus Dendromutantus Vulgaris. I mostly find and document new species of mutant animals, their traits and distinctive features. The information is then thoroughly studied and transferred to the outside world. Some of it, of course, goes to the Barman. My discoveries have helped to save the lives of many stalkers. I was just transporting the results of my latest research to the laboratory near Lake Yantar when the helicopter came under fire.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_12">
		<text>Tell me about the Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_121">
		<text>The Zone is a wonderful gift to humanity. Of course, normal existence here is not possible due to the high radiation levels, anomalies, aggressive mutants. All of these things are obviously extremely dangerous but they are simultaneously things of great scientific value. The Zone is almost a natural experiment, a treasure for scientists! The extent to which humanity's knowledge could be increased through the study of the Zone is unfathomable. Technology, medicine, new plants (medical and edible), biotechnology, cures for incurable diseases...anything! Perhaps we can solve the food problem for the entire planet. If only people didn't interfere, science could lead humanity into a new Golden Era!</text>

		<text>Duty thinks otherwise and even Freedom doesn't seem to want to help you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_12111">
		<text>You're simply incapable of grasping the whole picture. Your "here and now" problems are far more important to you than the future of humanity!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_1212">
		<text>Maybe there is some use in studying the Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_12121">
		<text>You understand that too? It's wonderful to discover that there are those among you who are not narrow-minded practical people. I've always said - it's important to look at the whole set of issues from a broader perspective, to distance ourselves from the simple human measures. Even if the Zone has done harm to humanity, it can be of great use to us, of great use!</text>

	<string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_13">
		<text>Why are Mercs looking for this information?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_131">
		<text>I hope this doesn't offend you, but many stalkers are like children. They are seriously affected by things they find out. Just think of all these legends about a Monolith that grants wishes. What a joke! The problem is that these children play their games with real weapons and cause death. Childish people are often annoyed about the fact that someone doesn't share everything with them, including information that is not meant for them. There are no limits in the use of force, they shoot without thinking and kill those who study the Zone. They believe that this information will allow them to open the way to the center of the Zone. They're fools, dangerous and naive fools!</text>
