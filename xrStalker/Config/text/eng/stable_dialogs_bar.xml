    <string id="bar_arena_manager_info_11">
        <text>What's the establishment?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_info_111">
        <text>This is my buisiness in the area here. Arena is a place where any stalker will be able to test his forces in a duel with mutants. And if the stalker is skillful enough - \nhe can earn some money as well. Excitement is something even stalkers possess. About a year and a half ago I was cleansing a nest of bloodsuckers with a \nfriend of mine. We ran the last one, a full-grown one into a house, got all the exits blocked, then sat down waiting. And then my friend utters - I bet I do him in \nwithin 2 minutes. He entered the dwelling and did him in. That was the moment when the idea originated. We made a deal with the Duty, grabbed a hangar to \nmake an arena out of it. Now we have our own business in the Zone.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_info_12">
        <text>How do live mutants appear here?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_info_121">
        <text>We made a deal with the Duty. Previously they killed everyone when cleansing, but later I proposed them money in exchange for injured weakened mutants. We \nreached agreement fast. From that moment on I have a virtually never-ending source of live mutants. Later I get the bodies stuffed to sell beyond the zone limits. \nThey are extremely popular.</text>

        <text>Where are you from?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_info_131">
        <text>Where from? From many places. I don't even know what to consider my homeland. A long time I spent in Africa, then several years in Ecuador. And then I heard \nabout this cute place and understood that I can earn a good penny here.</text>

    <string id="bar_arena_manager_rules_0">
        <text>What are the rules?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_rules_1">
        <text>Oh, the rules are pretty simple. I invented them myslef. There's a cage, and a mutant is let inside the cage. You pay money, so as choose a time you need to kill \nthe monster. If you make it - you get the win. If you don't cope with it - I keep the money. Should you die - I oblige to bury you with all the ceremonies as proper. \nThe less is the time you choose, the bigger is the win.</text>

        <text>There's a serious affair. On the 'wild territory' there is a group of stalker veterans and I hear recently about frequent cases of death of lone stalkers in their 'region'. \nPeople from the Duty came to me asking to settle it with these veterans. The Duty have indisputable proof of the veterans involved in killing the loners. The thing \nis, they have an old agreement with Duty, which the Duty cannot violate, and the former guys got too insolent now. To cut it brief, teh Duty want them to be \nqueitly eliminated. The task is tough, but is well-paid.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_bar_barmen_jobs_23111">
        <text>Are there any other extra conditions? And it looks weird that the Duty let it go like this.</text>

        <text>The Duty take care of their reputation. That's why they want to make it quietly. Eliminating the leader nicknamed "Lucky" and bringing his PDA as proof \nwould be enough for you.</text>

        <text>Deal. Hopefully I'll never regret it.</text>

        <text>Stalkers have been for several years now interested in revealing the pass to the north, to the centre. But so far the passage is closed, and those who went there \nnever returned. There's info about some 'brain scorcher', who blocks the way to the north, but what is it - nobody knows. On the documents you brought from \nAgroprom, something starts to clarify. It looks like the 'brain scorcher' is of cosmetic nature. We need more data to tell for sure. In the documents laboratory X18 is \nmentioned to have allegedly also worked on the project. The descriptions match with neglected underground premises in the Dark Valley, known as 'dark \nlaboratory'.</text>

        <text>If you bring the folders with documents on 'antennae' or 'radiators', I will pay you lavishly. To achieve that you'll need to examine the laboratory thoroughly. When \nthe Zone blew out, no one had time to evacuate anything. Certainly there is a lot left there.</text>

        <text>Leader of one of the groupings. No one has seen him, but there were a lot of rumors about him, Ghost and Fang, having reached the center of the Zone. \nGunslinger and Fang dissappeared, while Ghost has been seen not so long ago. He came back alive, but being a little downcast.</text>

    <string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_41">
        <text>Kind of eerie guy, tall, reserved, with long nose. Was good at shooting, and could sneak into anywhere, silently and undetected.

    <string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_51">
        <text>Old stalker, who have dealt with his business. Lives at the bogs, I'll mark it on your map. In due time he was closely connected with Gunslinger's group.</text>

        <text>What do you know about the stalker named Fang?</text>

    <string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_61">
        <text>There've been such a guy, he was burring much. He was out of his mind, used to talked to himself, but fine on the other hand. Got lost in the center, together \nwith Gunslinger, however it's said that Gunslinger has returned. </text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_7">
        <text>Tell me about the mobile scientific laboratories.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_71">
        <text>As you have possibly heard, several governmental organizations are studying "glitches" of our Zone. Rumors say, that these experiments caused it to perk \nup. Gunslinger with his group tried to make out if it was really so, but eventually Gunslinger's group was destroyed and he himself fell missing. Although, the \ntruth is unknown to me, only conjectures. Scientific organizations leave in mobile scientific laboratories in the Zone, isolated from the external environment \nmetal bunkers, inside them is everything that is necessary to examine the Zone. We are in contact with one laboratory at Yantar. They are good guys, have \ndisclosed a lot of interesting information for us, we didn't stay in debt... hehe... mutually benefical barter, you got it.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_8">
        <text>What is the "wish master"?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_81">
        <text>Ooo! This is a very interesting question, and I'd like to have a correct answer to it. I can tell you the legend about the "master", while you will decide how \ntruthful it is. Well, will you listen?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_811">
        <text>Yes, very interesting.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_8111">
        <text>This is a legend about the Monolith, quite possible that it is the reason of Zone's beginning. The Zone blew up in 2006, measures were taken and the \ninhabitants around it were evacuated, and the Zone was cordoned off by the army detachments. Nobody knew, what was happening around, Zone grew \nlarger, field laboratories. A lot of people died there. Everyone is afraid of the radiation, which can cover the half of Europe. Several years have passed, first \ndesperate guys, just like you, showed up. They called themselves stalkers. They infiltrated through the army cordons, believing that there is something inside \nthe Zone, which can be of great wealth for them. Slowly, they started to fetch strange things out of there, artifacts, which momentary caused the rush. \nScientists went mad, natural hysterics. One single sample was duly paid with fantastic sums of money, not like now.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_81111">
        <text>Go on...</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_811111">
        <text>So, then came the first legends and stories about what is placed inside the Zone, near the tumbledown APP. Then one of the veterans retold the story, heard \nfrom one of the local stalkers-old-timers about the Monolith, as if it were fulfilling the wishes. What a hysteria broke up, stalkers divided into groupings and \nstrived eagerly to the center of the Zone, everyone wanted something from the Monolith. A lot of obscure details appeared about the first stalker, who made \nit to the Monolith...</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_8111111">
        <text>Go on... proceed...</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_81111111">
        <text>Even when the Zone appeared, a lot of people appeared under its dome, cut from the outer world. The majority died right away, but occasional lucky beggars \nremained, not only those who survived, but who tried to attemp something as well. One of the survivals trapped near the station, inside it he noticed a \nstrange fluorescence, he had no choice, the way back was barred, and so he came closer. He saw the picture of the pierced roof of sarcophagus, with the \nluminiscence breaking through it. He climbed the wall and the inner site revealed in front of him, amongst the heaps of metal flinders and adust concrete \nplates a huge black splinter rose high. This was the Monolith, stalker at last awaken from a strange delusion and realized, that he is right inside the \nSarcophagus. He was seized by a deep fear, with the monotonous call of Monolith breaking through his mind. Monolith called for him, while stalker had his \nhair standing on end, his head was pierced by strange, unbelievable pictures about the Monolith...</text>

    <string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_811111112">
        <text>I don't know, what in this story is true and what is false. The point is that he made a wish and it has been fulfilled, and the Zone increased in 5 kilometers. It \nseems that for each wish granted the Zone consumes a portion of our planet Earth. But this doesn't stops such brave guys as you are. They continue to be \nbreaking in, wearing sacred wishes inside their hearts.</text>

        <text>Me, Humpback and Spotted one were planning a breakthrough to the North for long. We had been missing only the time of recession of the 'scorcher's' \nradiation, and Spotted one got this information, who from I have no idea. We passed half the Radar as 'scorcher' unexpectedly switched on. Spotted one got \noff the handle, lost consciousness and fell off the slope. I panicked, decided to leave it all and return. Humpback insisted on pulling out the Spotten one, but \nthat was a pure suicide to get down and pull the Spotted one all the way back. I agreed with the Humpback and crawled down the slope to the Spotted one, \nbut another splash of the 'scorcher' nearly covered us. I got my mind clear only near the military base, until then I considered them dead, but it looks like \nHumpback at the cost of his life managed to pull the Spotted one out.</text>

        <text>Сейчас я не готов ответить на этот вопрос. Что я могу сказать, так это то, что я не состою ни в одной из группировок.</text>

        <text>Я мало знаю о группировке "Свобода". Не мог бы ты меня немного просветить?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_bar_osvedomitel_talk_about_freedom_1">
        <text>Sure, Branded One! Not a question at all. "Freedom" is one of the eldest factions in the Zone, and the only one, which withstands the governmental forces \nand research groups in a straightforward manner. Their foundants have perished during the skirmish with governmental forces, during the large-scale \nlanding operation in the Zone.  The possibility of military-governmental control was abolished. And pehaps, this haven't given chance to dash down to a new \nworld war, using new technologies. According to scrappy information, Zone is the secret military polygon, which experienced the tests of was technologies. \nAnd the result is at least impressive. Freedom is the only faction, which is resistant to returning the polygon to the governmental forces. What happens if the \npolygon is returned, it must be protected at all costs.</text>

    <string id="bar_bar_osvedomitel_talk_about_freedom_2">
        <text>Если "Свобода" хочет удержать военный полигон в своих руках, то чего добивается "Долг"?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_bar_osvedomitel_talk_about_freedom_3">
        <text>Duty is the division of governmental forces, which are controlled from outside. Their goals are cleanup of the territory and elimination of Freedom's faction, \nwhich they actually do. As soon as the last remaining obstacle is removed, a numerous landing force will be dropped into the Zone, which will take control of \nit.</text>

        <text>Для новичка говоришь? Ну слушай. На севере, совсем недалеко от "выжигателя мозгов", на старой военной базе находится группировка "Свобода". Отъявленные нигилисты, анархисты и преступники. Борцы за свободу, едрить их налево. Партизаны хреновы. Все чем они занимаются это диверсии против научных групп, обстрел армейских частей и постоянная грызня с Долгом, недавно перешедшая в маленькую войну на выживание. Я могу дать тебе только один совет - никогда с ними не связывайся, туда только совсем оторваных принимают. Если за твою голову нет награды, не примут... Ха-ха-ха... можешь себе такое представить?</text>

        <text>Долг… хорошо звучит. Бывшие вояки, уважаю. Считают своим… хех… долгом защитить мир от нашествия мутантов. Наши охотники за вампирами. Только их не интересует мелочь, типа нашей "Дикой территории" им подавай гнезда да крупные скопления… горячие парни… Принимают к себе только ветеранов, оно и правильно, потому что они там в Долге не штаны протирают… а чисткой занимаются.</text>

        <text>Дааа, вот была группировка… хех… по всей Зоне про нее легенды ходили… Говорили о них и хорошее и плохое, только мало кто правду знал. А правда-то в том, что с Зоной они справиться хотели, раскапывали причины ее появления. За что и охотились на них военные сталкеры, только не знали, где искать. Правительственные организации что-то знали, чего обычным сталкерам знать не следует… так-то. В один прекрасный момент они нашли какую-то очень важную информацию и часть группировки, вместе со Стрелком, рванула к центру Зоны. Половина группы полегла при подходах, но они-таки добрались. Что с ними произошло потом, никто не знает. Сгинули они похоже. А оставшихся в группировке тем временем отловили да вырезали... и никто не выжил. Вот такая вот история.</text>

        <text>Торговцы говорят, что в центре Зоны "клондайк артефактов"… типа тот, кто туда проберется сказочно разбогатеет… хех. У меня на этот счет другое мнение, торговцам оно и понятно - о своей выгоде думают, да только ходят кое-какие слухи. Будто бы там кое-что получше, чем россыпь артефактов, что-то, что не принадлежит нашему миру, вроде как инопланетное или вообще из какого-то другого измерения. Исполнитель желаний называется, во как! Я даже легенду слышал о сталкере, который добрался до него. Только, говорят Зона растет, после каждого исполненного желания и те, кто туда добрались, похоже не загадывают, чтобы Зона исчезла. Видать, когда добираешься до исполнителя уже плевать на остальных, только своя шкура волнует.</text>

        <text>Верящие в Монолит - психи. Они кричат о нем, но никто не знает, что находится в центре Зоны. Невидимый кристалл упавший с небес… Ха-ха. Я думаю, это рванула одна из секретных лабораторий. Кто-то даже говорил, что когда-то работал там. Но, конечно, бомбить Зону нельзя, мало того, что радиацию разнесет по всему миру, так еще реакция Зоны может разворотить пол-Европы… Последнее время что-то совсем у них крыша съехала… я слышал, что простых сталкеров убивать начали, за просто так.

        <text>Посмотрим, посмотрим. Но, прежде чем делать выводы, пройди маленькую проверку. Тебе надо достать архивную папку из заброшенного здания напротив.

        <text>Что еще я могу сделать для Долга?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_dolg_leader_job_1">
        <text>Хороший вопрос, Меченый, и на него есть хороший ответ - уничтожай анархистов группировки Свобода и за каждый PDA анархиста ты будешь получать вознаграждения, кроме того, сможешь получишь новое звание. Все PDA неси к Петренко, он выдает вознаграждение.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_dolg_leader_join_0">
        <text>Я хочу вступить в группировку Долг.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_dolg_leader_join_1">
        <text>Похвальное желание. Полковник Петренко и капитан Иванцов мне уже доложили о тебе. Прежде, чем принять тебя, я хочу попросить выполнить одно дело. Лично для меня, понимаешь?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_dolg_leader_join_11">
        <text>Думаю, что понимаю. Что я должен сделать?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_dolg_leader_join_111">
        <text>Видишь ли, тут такое дело. Сейчас у нас идут территориальные боевые действия с группой Свободы и нам не хватает оружия помощней того, что у нас есть. У Свободы есть несколько отличных гранатометов РГ-6, если бы у тебя получилось проникнуть на территорию Свободы и выкрасть хотя бы один такой гранатомет, то я бы с удовольствием принял такого отважного сталкера в нашу группировку. Пока ты не в группировке, ты легко можешь втереться в доверие к Свободе и при удачном раскладе спереть РГ-6. Ну, что думаешь?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_dolg_leader_join_1111">
        <text>Хорошо, я возьмусь выкрасть РГ-6 у Свободы.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_dolg_leader_join_11111">
        <text>Ну вот и отлично. Я скину тебе информацию по местонахождению складов на территории военной базы, на которой сейчас размещена Свобода. И еще совет - у нас есть информация на некоего Повара, члена группы "Свободы", он знает где именно хранится РГ-6. Он слаб на выпивку, поэтому постарайся его опоить. Короче говоря, возьми побольше водки. Хехе. Пригодится.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_dolg_leader_join_111111">
        <text>Это все?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_dolg_leader_join_1111111">
        <text>И еще одно напоследок. Полковник Череп со своими ребятами ослушались моего приказа и самовольно отправились штурмовать базу "Свободы". Самоубийцы, ну так пусть получат сполна. Черепа уже давно пора было проучить. Не вмешивайся в их личную войну, постарайся втереться в доверие к "Свободе" и добудь мне РГ6, остальное не важно.</text>

    <string id="bar_dolg_leader_join_1112">

        <text>Prior to the accident in 86 this was an industrial zone. Now, as far as you understand, only the demolished ruins remain. Near the hangar you might find "100 \nRontgen" bar, stalkers from all over the Zone drop in there, local trader works as the barkeep, keeps so to say the premises. Go there if you want to trade, \ntalk or receive an interesting task, you'll also find out some fresh news. There is an Arena, where you can battle mutants and earn some money there. Not \nfar from the arena one might find Duty's faction base. If you want to try to enter Duty, you have to go straightly that way, they'll tell whom must you apply to. \nAll that territory is under Duty's control, thus behave yourself carefully, don't draw your gun without any reason, and if you are not wise enough to start \nshooting, patrol shall calm you in one go.</text>

        <text>My name is Kruglov. I'm the professor of biology, I examine the Zone, classifying everything that I might find. Well, for example, yesterday I encountered very interesting species of Antropomorphus Dendromutantus Vulgaris. I work in the Zone, discovering and describing new types of mutated animals, their habits and peculiarities. Then this information is analyzed and I hand it over to the academy of sciences, something even tell to the barkeep. My discoveries have saved stalkers' lives more than once. In respond we seek help from the stalkers time to time. I was just carrying the results of my investigations to Yantar, when my helicopter fired upon.</text>

    <string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_1112">
        <text>Well. I guess it's now really pleasant to land the "wild territory" in the ablaze copter.</text>

        <text>You are supposed to know a lot about the Zone. Maybe you can share with me the information you possess?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_121">
        <text>Zone - is the perfect gift to the humanity. No doubt there can be no living in here, radiation, anomalies, mutants are mortally dangerous, but they present a huge scientific value. This is nearly a natural experiment, a real reserve for the scientists. It's hard to imagine what might happen to the science after the examination of the Zone. New technologies, medicines, sorts of plants, herbs and edible ones. Biotechnologies, curing untreatable illnesses and what of it. The global Earth foodstuff problem might be solved. If it were not for the preventers we could possible be leading the humanity to the "golden age".</text>

        <text>Do you see it as well? How lovely is to find a conversable different from narrow-minded practician. I always say that the problem must be treated much broader, that the human yardsticks evaded. Maybe there is the harm from the Zone, but there can be benefit as well, and the benefit is huge I admit.</text>

    <string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_121211">
        <text>As a rule those "non narrow-minded practicians" can't survive in the Zone. That's the way the cookie crumbles.</text>

    <string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_131">
        <text>Stalkers are like children, no offence though. They are really influenced by what they catch on. Consider for example stalkers legends about wish-granting "Monolith". This is truly a kind of childish folly. However this folly causes dangerous games with weapons and they even cost lives. And "Freedom" is behaving like an offended child, who is kept away from the dangerous information. Although they have not the sticks but guns and automatics. They see no bounds in acts of force, they are eager to shoot eliminating the researchers of the Zone. It seems to them that if they possessed this information the gates to the center of the Zone would open to them. Just naive fools, and, unfortunately, very dangerous fools.</text>
