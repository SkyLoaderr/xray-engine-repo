        <text>Shoot.</text>

        <text>No more questions here.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_info_11">
        <text>What's the establishment?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_info_111">
        <text>This is my buisiness in the area here. Arena is a place where any stalker will be able to test his forces in a duel with mutants. And if the stalker is skillful enough - \nhe can earn some money as well. Excitement is something even stalkers possess. About a year and a half ago I was cleansing a nest of bloodsuckers with a \nfriend of mine. We ran the last one, a full-grown one into a house, got all the exits blocked, then sat down waiting. And then my friend utters - I bet I do him in \nwithin 2 minutes. He entered the dwelling and did him in. That was the moment when the idea originated. We made a deal with the Duty, grabbed a hangar to \nmake an arena out of it. Now we have our own business in the Zone.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_info_12">
        <text>How do live mutants appear here?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_info_121">
        <text>We made a deal with the Duty. Previously they killed everyone when cleansing, but later I proposed them money in exchange for injured weakened mutants. We \nreached agreement fast. From that moment on I have a virtually never-ending source of live mutants. Later I get the bodies stuffed to sell beyond the zone limits. \nThey are extremely popular.</text>

    <string id="bar_arena_manager_info_13">
        <text>Where are you from?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_info_131">
        <text>Where from? From many places. I don't even know what to consider my homeland. A long time I spent in Africa, then several years in Ecuador. And then I heard \nabout this cute place and understood that I can earn a good penny here.</text>

    <string id="bar_arena_manager_rules_0">
        <text>What are the rules?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_rules_1">
        <text>Oh, the rules are pretty simple. I invented them myslef. There's a cage, and a mutant is let inside the \ncage. You pay money, so as choose a time you need to kill \nthe monster. If you make it - you get the win. If you don't cope with it - I keep the money. Should you \ndie - I oblige to bury you with all the ceremonies as proper. \nThe less is the time you choose, the bigger is the win.</text>

    <string id="bar_arena_manager_start_41">
        <text>There you are! Well done! Get your win. If you desire another fight for money - drop in.</text>

        <text>Stalkers have been for several years now interested in revealing the pass to the north, to the centre. \nBut so far the passage is closed, and those who went there \nnever returned. There's info about some 'brain scorcher', who blocks the way to the north, but what is \nit - nobody knows. On the documents you brought from \nAgroprom, something starts to clarify. It looks like the 'brain scorcher' is of cosmetic nature. We \nneed more data to tell for sure. In the documents laboratory X18 is \nmentioned to have allegedly also worked on the project. The descriptions match with neglected \nunderground premises in the Dark Valley, known as 'dark \nlaboratory'.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_bar_barmen_jobs_room_11">
        <text>Want me to go to the 'dark laboratory'? And what's the reward?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_bar_barmen_jobs_room_111">
        <text>If you bring the folders with documents on 'antennae' or 'radiators', I will pay you lavishly. To achieve \nthat you'll need to examine the laboratory thoroughly. When the Zone blew out, no one had time to \nevacuate anything. Certainly there is a lot left there. So seek well. And one more, you won't come \nthrough, the radiation level is to high.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_bar_barmen_jobs_room_1111">
        <text>I'll try, but I got a feeling you've sent a lot of stalkers there.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_bar_barmen_jobs_room_11111">
        <text>The task is dangerous, no doubt. What's going on there right now is unknown, moreover, the Dark \nValley has always been an unsafe place. Bandits have made a base there. I've sent peoples there, \nseveral Duty-scouts. Looks like they were killed by bandits. So it does make sence to visit Hog- \nbandits leader.</text>

        <text>It's your decision, Branded one. But keep in mind, this is the only link to help us solve the 'brain scorcher' and pass to the north. Sooner or later someone will have \nto deal with it.</text>

        <text>Listen here, Branded one. You've got the 'cap' to cover from 'brain scorcher', so as you've got the \ntime when it's deactivated All in all you have half an hour available, and you've got to enter the \nbunker and switch off the 'scorcher' within this time.

We need to find an \nanswer to the question -"how to pass it". In these documents there is reference to the certain \nlaboratory of ?16, where the prepared blocks left...I do not know exactly where it is...There is \nreference that she is located on territory production complex near a lake Jantar...The scientists not \nfar away from there a mobile laboratory was broken up and they certainly will prompt more precisely. \nSo go to scientists, and make an effort to find this X16 and extract any interesting us \ninformation.</text>

        <text>That's crap, Branded one, pure crap. Do you understand how they are needed? And they are needed \ndesperately, believe me. We've got a brain scorcher \nneighbouring, and we don't even know what it is. Go to get the documents immediately. All the talks \nwill be later.</text>

    <string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_room_33">
        <text>According to the documents which you brought from Agroprom, something begins to clear up, but it \nis not enough information. There is information about certain "brains scorcher", which blocks up the \nway to the north, but what is it - nobody knows. The laboratory X18 is also mentioned, descriptions \ncoincide with neglected underground apartments in Dark Valley. It's unknown what is going on there, \nbesides gangsters founded their own base in a dark valley. We've sent some Duty spies in there, but \nthere is no news from them yet. In order to get to the laboratory you need two electronic keys, one of \nthem I give you, and it will be necessary to get the second one from Hog. He is the leader of \ngangsters.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_room_331">
        <text>Go on</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_room_332">
        <text>So, you have to get the second key from a laboratory from Hog. Then you have to get to the \nlaboratory and obtain documents. Do not forget to purchase a suit protecting from a radiation, you \nwon't force your way through to a dark \nvalley without it. There is too strong radiation level. Are you ready?</text>

    <string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_room_41">
        <text>So, Branded One. You have a protective prototype, against "scorcher", and you know time when \nplant is disconnected. During this time you must make your way into a bunker and cut off \n"scorcher". What will be then, I don't know. But I feel it worthy of it.</text>

        <text>Ooo! This is a very interesting question, and I'd like to have a correct answer to it. I can tell you the legend about the "master", while you will decide how \ntruthful it is. Well, will you listen?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_811">
        <text>Yes, very interesting.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_8111">
        <text>This is a legend about the Monolith, quite possible that it is the reason of Zone's beginning. The Zone blew up in 2006, measures were taken and the \ninhabitants around it were evacuated, and the Zone was cordoned off by the army detachments. Nobody knew, what was happening around, Zone grew \nlarger, field laboratories. A lot of people died there. Everyone is afraid of the radiation, which can cover the half of Europe. Several years have passed, first \ndesperate guys, just like you, showed up. They called themselves stalkers. They infiltrated through the army cordons, believing that there is something inside \nthe Zone, which can be of great wealth for them. Slowly, they started to fetch strange things out of there, artifacts, which momentary caused the rush. \nScientists went mad, natural hysterics. One single sample was duly paid with fantastic sums of money, not like now.</text>

    </string>
    <string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_811111">
        <text>So, then came the first legends and stories about what is placed inside the Zone, near the tumbledown APP. Then one of the veterans retold the story, heard \nfrom one of the local stalkers-old-timers about the Monolith, as if it were fulfilling the wishes. What a hysteria broke up, stalkers divided into groupings and \nstrived eagerly to the center of the Zone, everyone wanted something from the Monolith. A lot of obscure details appeared about the first stalker, who made \nit to the Monolith...</text>

    <string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_8111111">
        <text>Go on... proceed...</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_81111111">
        <text>Even when the Zone appeared, a lot of people appeared under its dome, cut from the outer world. The majority died right away, but occasional lucky beggars \nremained, not only those who survived, but who tried to attemp something as well. One of the survivals trapped near the station, inside it he noticed a \nstrange fluorescence, he had no choice, the way back was barred, and so he came closer. He saw the picture of the pierced roof of sarcophagus, with the \nluminiscence breaking through it. He climbed the wall and the inner site revealed in front of him, amongst the heaps of metal flinders and adust concrete \nplates a huge black splinter rose high. This was the Monolith, stalker at last awaken from a strange delusion and realized, that he is right inside the \nSarcophagus. He was seized by a deep fear, with the monotonous call of Monolith breaking through his mind. Monolith called for him, while stalker had his \nhair standing on end, his head was pierced by strange, unbelievable pictures about the Monolith...</text>

        <text>I don't know, what in this story is true and what is false. The point is that he made a wish and it has been fulfilled, and the Zone increased in 5 kilometers. It \nseems that for each wish granted the Zone consumes a portion of our planet Earth. But this doesn't stops such brave guys as you are. They continue to be \nbreaking in, wearing sacred wishes inside their hearts.</text>

    <string id="bar_bar_lisiy_talk_1">
        <text>So what?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_bar_lisiy_talk_2">
        <text>The Spotted one was taken out of Radar, this is what. And the Humpback perished, according to the Spotted.</text>

        <text>Damn.</text>

    <string id="bar_bar_lisiy_talk_5">
        <text>No, no, no! I'm to blame for the Humpback's death, and the Spotted one's injuries too. At the toughest moment I betrayed them and ran away. I will not be able \nto look into the Spotted one's eyes now.</text>

        <text>Tell me in more detail about what happened.</text>

    <string id="bar_bar_lisiy_talk_7">
        <text>Me, Humpback and Spotted one were planning a breakthrough to the North for long. We had been missing only the time of recession of the 'scorcher's' \nradiation, and Spotted one got this information, who from I have no idea. We passed half the Radar as 'scorcher' unexpectedly switched on. Spotted one got \noff the handle, lost consciousness and fell off the slope. I panicked, decided to leave it all and return. Humpback insisted on pulling out the Spotten one, but \nthat was a pure suicide to get down and pull the Spotted one all the way back. I agreed with the Humpback and crawled down the slope to the Spotted one, \nbut another splash of the 'scorcher' nearly covered us. I got my mind clear only near the military base, until then I considered them dead, but it looks like \nHumpback at the cost of his life managed to pull the Spotted one out.</text>

    </string>
    <string id="bar_bar_osvedomitel_talk_about_freedom_1">
        <text>Sure, Branded One! Not a question at all. "Freedom" is one of the eldest factions in the Zone, and the only one, which withstands the governmental forces \nand research groups in a straightforward manner. Their foundants have perished during the skirmish with governmental forces, during the large-scale \nlanding operation in the Zone. The possibility of military-governmental control was abolished. And pehaps, this haven't given chance to dash down to a new \nworld war, using new technologies. According to scrappy information, Zone is the secret military polygon, which experienced the tests of was technologies. \nAnd the result is at least impressive. Freedom is the only faction, which is resistant to returning the polygon to the governmental forces. What happens if the \npolygon is returned, it must be protected at all costs.</text>

    <string id="bar_bar_osvedomitel_talk_about_freedom_2">

        <text>Duty is the division of governmental forces, which are controlled from outside. Their goals are cleanup of the territory and elimination of Freedom's faction, \nwhich they actually do. As soon as the last remaining obstacle is removed, a numerous landing force will be dropped into the Zone, which will take control of \nit.</text>

Notorious nihilists, anarchists and \ncriminals. Champions of freedom, damn them all. Partisans, damn it. All what they are engaged in is \ndiversions against scientific groups, fire of army units and permanent fight with Duty, recently \npassing to little war on a survival. I can give you only one advice - never contact them, only crazy \naccepted there. If for your head there is not a reward, will not accept... Ha-ha... can you imagine it?\n</text>

        <text>Well, there was such a faction once... heh... legends spread through the entire Zone... It was said in both good and bad way, but only few knew the truth. \nWhile the truth is that they wanted do deal with the Zone, digging for the actual reasons of its appearance. That is why they were hunted by military stalkers, \nwho basically had no idea where to search for them. Governmental organizations knew something, which mustn't be revealed to the common stalkers... that's \nas right. At one fine moment they found some very important information and the part of the grouping, together with the Gunslinger rushed to the center of the \nZone. Half of the grouping was obliterated on the approaches, but they've made it after all. What happened then is unknown. It seems that they've all died. \nAnd the ones who survived were hunt down, captured and slaughtered... no one survived. That's the whole story.</text>

We passed the floor of Radar, as "scorcher" was unexpectedly \nturned on. Spoted went crazy, he had lost consciousness and knocked down from a slope. I was in \npanic, and decided to give up everything and return. A Hunchback insisted to rescu? Spotted, but it \nwould be the pure suicide, to go down and pull Spotted the whole way back. I agreed with \nHunchback and he started to climb downward on a slope towards Spotted, untill the next splash of \n"scorcher" hit us.

        <text>Good question, Branded One, which eventually has a good answer - eliminate anarchists of Freedom faction and for each anarchist's PDA you will receive \nrewards, besides you can obtain a new rank. Give all PDAs to Pentrenko, he pays out the fee.</text>

        <text>I think I got. What must I do?</text>

    <string id="bar_dolg_leader_join_111">
        <text>You see, now we are engaged in territorial combat actions with Freedom faction and we lack in weapons more powerful than we've got. Freedom has some perfect RG-6 grenade launchers, if you manage to slip into the territory of that factions and steal at least one such grenade launcher, I would gladly enroll a courageous stalker in our faction. Until you're not in the faction, you can easily warm yourself into Freedom's confidence and if you are lucky enough you can snatch RG-6 from the warehouse. Well, what do you think?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_dolg_leader_join_1111">
        <text>Good, I'll try to steal RG-6 from Freedom.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_dolg_leader_join_11111">
        <text>Well, that's great. I'll copy you the information on the location of warehouses on the territory of the military base, where Freedom faction is now situated. And one more advice - we have a profile for some Cook, member of "Freedom" grouping, he knows the exact place where RG-6 is kept. He has a weak point in drinking, thus try to make him drunk. In short, take a little more vodka with you. hehe. He can make a good use of it.</text>

    <string id="bar_dolg_leader_join_111111">
        <text>That's it?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_dolg_leader_join_1111111">
        <text>And one more thing. Colonel Skull together with his guys disobeyed my order and went assaulting Freedom base unauthorized. Self-killers, let them get in full what they deserve. Skull must have been taught a lesson long ago. Don't interfere in their personal war, try to warm into Freedom's confidence and get RG-6 for me, the other things are not as important for me.</text>

        <text>My name is Kruglov. I'm the professor of biology, I examine the Zone, classifying everything that I might find. Well, for example, yesterday I encountered very interesting species of Antropomorphus Dendromutantus Vulgaris. I work in the Zone, discovering and describing new types of mutated animals, their habits and peculiarities. Then this information is analyzed and I hand it over to the academy of sciences, something even tell to the barkeep. My discoveries have saved stalkers' lives more than once. In respond we seek help from the stalkers time to time. I was just carrying the results of my investigations to Yantar, when my helicopter fired upon.</text>

        <text>Zone - is the perfect gift to the humanity. No doubt there can be no living in here, radiation, anomalies, mutants are mortally dangerous, but they present a huge scientific value. This is nearly a natural experiment, a real reserve for the scientists. It's hard to imagine what might happen to the science after the examination of the Zone. New technologies, medicines, sorts of plants, herbs and edible ones. Biotechnologies, curing untreatable illnesses and what of it. The global Earth foodstuff problem might be solved. If it were not for the preventers we could possible be leading the humanity to the "golden age".</text>

    <string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_131">
        <text>Stalkers are like children, no offence though. They are really influenced by what they catch on. Consider for example stalkers legends about wish-granting "Monolith". This is truly a kind of childish folly. However this folly causes dangerous games with weapons and they even cost lives. And "Freedom" is behaving like an offended child, who is kept away from the dangerous information. Although they have not the sticks but guns and automatics. They see no bounds in acts of force, they are eager to shoot eliminating the researchers of the Zone. It seems to them that if they possessed this information the gates to the center of the Zone would open to them. Just naive fools, and, unfortunately, very dangerous fools.</text>
