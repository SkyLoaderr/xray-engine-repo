		<text>What?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_arena_man_job_11">
		<text>So, your first fight? Well then, remember: your opponent is a piece of meat just like you. He's here because of debts and he only has two options: to come out and fight or to land himself in the nearest anomaly. You getting the picture? He's gonna sell his life dearly.  \nEquipment for today... lemme think... OK! Why don't you two use a couple of Makarovs...two clips each should be plenty. Either you kick his arse or you we feed you to the dogs - the choice is yours. Go on now.</text>

	<string id="bar_arena_man_job_12">
		<text>You last fight didn't mean shit, you understand? You're still the same piece of meat you were before and no self-respecting stalker will bet a single mag on you. If you wanna make some proper cash you're gonna have to make a few more appearances in the arena. \nYour new opponent also got through the first round and his fight was a lot harder than yours. I don't like him to be honest - he kills too quickly and the crowd don't like that. OK, now go on and show us what you can do! The bets will increase after this fight. Move it!</text>

		<text>Well, well mate... I'll tell you it straight, I thought you were a pussy at first. Now it's time for you to be in a real fight. \nYou're up against two guys. The first one's called Swede and I don't remember the second one's name. They were paired up intentionally as they hate each other's guts so don't worry about them working as a team. Today is rifle day so don't let them get too close or we'll have to mop you up with a broom and dustpan. The odds are 10:1 so if you win you'll make a fair amount, got it? Off you go!</text>

		<text>Well mate, you're a fighter, a real fighter. I'm impressed. \nNow you're gonna have to work as part of a team. You get to fight with two others on your side...they're brothers so I had to put them into a team fight even tho' they're total rookies. I wouldn't expect any real help from them if I were you. You're fighting an experienced team, they're contenders for the final this season. Dangerous lot. They use different weapons: most of them have AK-74s but one has an automatic shotgun and that thing is a beast, believe you me. Good luck, mate... you're gonna need it.</text>

		<text>You've got a special fight today. Can you believe this shit, even the army has heard about you! Don't be surprised, they fight here too - there's even a general in the crowd...\nAnyway, I was saying - you're up against two guys from OMON. They're well armed and their armour is good as you'd expect so keep that in mind but don't worry, I ain't gonna leave you out to dry either. You'll get a vest that Freedom use - it's light so it won't slow you down. Go on, show them that stalkers ain't no whipping boys. Good luck!</text>

		<text>Time for you to show what you can do. Duty captured a group of bandits that had been causing problems for stalkers in the Wild Territory. They did it pretty well and most of the bandits were taken alive. They were all gonna be executed anyway so I had a word with someone who knows someone... \nTo make a long story short you're about to meet them. If any of them survive they'll go to the can outside the Zone, which is better than dying here. They're not armed very well - just a few pistols and sawn-offs - but there's six of them so watch yourself. Go on now!</text>

		<text>Well, you owe me a drink, my friend! You're almost in the final. \nNow you'll be fighting a real pro. He's alone but he's got an F2000 and he's inside an exoskeleton. Catch one burst and you're toast. He's got another trick up his sleeve too...but I can't tell you about it. Here's my advice: be prepared, it's gonna be tough. The winner makes it through to the final.</text>

There will be 4 stalkers in the arena: all real pros in exoskeletons with G36s but it's a fair deal this time - you'll get exactly what they have. The only thing is, you don't get medkits or bandages in a fight to the death. Ready? Go prove you're the best, mate!</text>

		<text>Hello, meat! If you haven't fought in the Arena you're meat and that's what you'll remain! Remember: you're a piece of meat, mate! The good thing is that this problem ain't hard to solve. Fight and prove that you're a real man! \nThe rules are as simple as it gets. Two pieces of meat... sometimes more... enter the Arena and try to beat their opponent by any means available. Whoever is standing at the end - wins. The loser is fed to the blind dogs. A weapon is chosen for every round but the fighters only find out what it is right before the fight. Don't worry tho', we don't send anyone into the Arena without some firepower. Your things will fit perfectly in this box, the one next to me...\nSo whaddaya say, meat?</text>

		<text>Well, well... here we go! The situation is becoming a bit clearer. Just as I thought, the Burner didn't appear all by itself. Wanna know what it is? It's a Kaimanov emitter...whatever that is. They made parts for it at X18.\nNow we need to find out how we can avoid being affected by it. There's a reference here... something called X16 where they sent units that were ready. Umm... here it is! It's located in the former production facility by Amber Lake.

		<text>I better start with the Monolith. It's some weird thing...no one really knows what it is or where it came from... maybe it's what caused the Zone to appear. When the station exploded in 2006 they tried to evacuate as many people as possible straight away. Everyone is panicking, nobody knows what's going on, the Zone is blocked off by the army on all sides but it's growing like it's alive! The field decontamination labs can't cope... \nIn the end, loads of people died and the whole of Europe was crapping its pants, afraid that the radiation might reach them. Not even a year had passed and already some brave guys and a few greedy ones appeared, calling themselves stalkers. They quietly snuck through army cordons and started bringing very strange things out of the Zone. There was a lot of interest in them and scientists went after them like crazy - whole institutes would squabble over good items. At first they paid huge money for just one trinket..how things change...</text>

		<text>After a while, the first tales and legends started appearing that talked about what's deep inside the Zone by the semi-destroyed nuclear station. It was then that one of the veterans told us the story of the Monolith that supposedly grants your wishes. You should have seen the hysteria: experienced, level-headed men started trying to break through to the centre in groups - everyone wanted something from the Monolith. All because of some story about the first stalker who made it there...a sad story if you ask me...</text>

		<text>When the second Zone had just appeared many people were cordoned off. Most of them died pretty quickly, of course, but there were a few lucky ones who survived... they tried to get out somehow and became the first stalkers, in a way. This one guy was trying to go around some anomalies and found himself by the station: there was no way back so he decided to try to get through the ruins. All of a sudden he saw some light - he assumed it was coming from a little camp fire. When he got a little closer he saw that it was coming through a small crack in the Sarcophagus. And the thing is, he knew it couldn't have been a fire but started climbing up for some reason. There was a hole at the top and through it he could see a massive black rock... or maybe not a rock, no one knows...but he could see it and what's more it's shape was... perfect. It was the Monolith. The guy managed to wake himself up right before he fell in. He got a hell of a shock: first of all, he nearly killed himself, secondly he climbed into the most radioactive place on the planet and third, it called to him. The Monolith called to him and called his name. It called to him and told him that it is the Monolith and what it can do...</text>

		<text>Tell me about Freedom.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_bar_osvedomitel_talk_about_freedom_1">
		<text>Sure, no problem! Freedom is one of the oldest groups in the Zone and the only one that openly opposes government troops and research teams. Its founders are dead - they were killed during a big bloodbath after the army dropped a large assault force in the Zone but the ability to control the Zone from outside was destroyed at the same time. There is some evidence to say that the first Zone was used as a secret army weapons testing site for trying out new weaponry. If that's true it must be some powerful shit.\nAnyway, what was I saying...? Oh yeah, Freedom is the only group that is trying to stop the government from getting control over the testing site again. God knows what will happen if they start testing their shit again so Freedom is trying to hold out at all costs.</text>

		<text>Duty is basically the vanguard of government forces. Not everyone knows this but Duty is controlled from the outside.

When the time is right they'll drop a new assault force in the Zone which will take control of the area.</text>

		<text>OK, I know where...or, actually, on who you can find an excellent modification of a sniper rifle. According to my information, there's some guy called Max in the middle of Freedom's base. Don't expect it to be easy, he's not just gonna give it up... on the other hand you can try to lure him out of the camp.

		<text>It's true that a standard AN-94 is known for it's accuracy but the kick on it ain't no joke... Well, anyway, there's a modified version in the Zone which currently belongs to the leader of a small group of mercenaries. The increased weight of this baby means the recoil is basically non-existent so draw your own conclusions. You can find this group at the Cordon - I heard they have some business at the rookie camp.

		<text>A Beretta is a real weapon for a real pro. You won't go wrong with this beauty anyway but a modified one is quite something - size matters and all that... Scientists aren't normally good with their hands but there's a craftsman among them who made it even better. The beast is even more powerful now and only a blind drunk would miss with it. You can find it in the scientists' bunker by Amber, obviously. Good luck.\n\n</text>

	<string id="bar_bar_osvedomitel_trade_info_5111">
		<text>There was this guy, he was a real gunsmith, you know? He produced a lot of really special items and the last thing he made was the modified LR-300, an attempt to make a sort of sniper rifle out of an automatic. It was made to order for Freedom - they never have the money for normal weapons. \nSo these three Freedom guys went to test the new weapon in a village full of bloodsuckers and obviously none of them came back. Their mates got a touch upset and didn't spend a long time looking for the guilty... that was the end of the gunsmith alright. So if you want the rifle, go to the village by the warehouses and look for it there.</text>

Just find Ara and you'll see it yourself...the problem is, it's usually neigh on impossible to find the slippery bastard.

The truth is that they wanted to deal with the Zone, find out what created it. That's why military stalkers were after them but they didn't know where to look for them. The government didn't want normal stalkers to know things they shouldn't have known. One day Sharpshooter found something really important and made a move towards the centre of the Zone with some of his boys. Half of the group died on the way but the rest made it through... What happened to them there - no one knows. They disappeared and nobody has heard from them. The others were caught and killed off... I don't think there are any of them left now.

We were half-way through the sector when the Burner suddenly switched on again. Spotty passed out straight away and fell down the hillside. I panicked and said that we should leave everything and go back. Hunchback managed to pull himself together and said that we gotta get Spotty out... I said "You're an idiot, don't you wanna live? It's over for him, how are we gonna carry him all the way back?" Just as he managed to convince me and started to climb down to get Spotty... another wave came.

		<text>Some missing stalkers have come back recently. It's a scary sight, I tell you: they mumble something and reach for their weapons, which they lost somewhere... One came to a Duty post some time ago and a crowd gathered to look at him. Someone even recognised him... He was scary...red eyes, all bloodshot and bruised...couldn't say a word, just moaned like an animal and went around in circles.

Obviously the traders think about their own interests but there are some rumours going around... There's something better than artifacts there - something that ain't from this world, something alien or from another dimension altogether! They call it the Wish-granting machine. I heard a story about a stalker who made it through and his wish was granted. Only every time someone makes a wish the Zone grows and nobody who gets there uses his wish to make it disappear.

	<string id="bar_dolg_newbie_start_21">
		<text>Hello, Marked One. I'm glad you're with us. Duty is really going to need good fighters soon. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_novice_start_2">
		<text>Hey fellow stalker.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_novice_start_3">
		<text>Tell me about Duty.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_novice_start_31">
		<text>We've been here from the beginning. The first group was made up of surviving officers and soldiers from special units sent into the Zone to find out what caused it to appear. Most of the personnel deployed for the operation died and those who survived swore that they will not leave here until they understand what is going on in the Zone. Until they defeat it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_novice_start_4">
		<text>Tell me about Freedom.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_novice_start_41">
		<text>They're thugs who don't understand that the Zone is an ulcer on the planet's body. They want to spread it all over the world, a piece in every household. They'll do anything to achieve the aims. I can't wait till we end them.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_novice_start_5">
		<text>You want to defeat the Zone?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_novice_start_51">
		<text>Yes and we partly manage. During Duty clearing operations whole swarms of mutants are destroyed on the way to the Zone's centre.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_novice_start_6">
		<text>Thank you.</text>

	<string id="bar_dolg_petrenko_start_11">

	<string id="bar_dolg_zastava_21">
		<text>Hey, man! I'm glad you haven't been eaten by mutants yet.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_zastava_about_zastava_0">
		<text>There was some slaughter by the post. What happened?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_zastava_about_zastava_1">
		<text>That's the last wave of mutants that came before the emission. It's quiet for three or four days and then they come again. If not for us, there'd be no Bar, there'd be no Duty; we're the last barrier in the mutants' way. A lot of our boys met their end here...</text>

		<text>What do you want to know?</text>

	<string id="bar_dolg_zastava_talk_2">
		<text>It's my first time here. Could you tell me a little about this place?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_zastava_talk_21">
		<text>Before the first accident this was an industrial area. As you can see, there ain't much left of it now... In the basement by the hangar you'll find the "100 roentgen" bar: the place is run by the local trader who doubles up as a barman. Stalkers come there from all over the Zone - if you want to trade, talk or find out the latest news it's the place to go. There's also the Arena where you can fight and make some cash. Duty's base is not far from the Arena. If you want to join Duty go straight over there - they'll tell you who to speak to. Oh, by the way, all of this area is protected by Duty so behave and keep your weapons holstered.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_dolg_zastava_talk_211">
		<text>You said there's a bar here. Can you tell me where it is, exactly?</text>

		<text>Thanks for the information.</text>

		<text>You said Duty's base is here. How do I get there?</text>

	<string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_0">
		<text>I'd like to know something.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_1">
		<text>What exactly would you like to know, stalker?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_11">
		<text>Who are you and how did you end up here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_111">
		<text>My name is Kruglov, professor Kruglov. I am a biologist studying the Zone. I mostly find and document new species of mutant animals, their traits and distinctive features. Yesterday, for example, I found an animal of particular interest... Where was I? Oh yes. The information is then thoroughly studied and I transfer it to the outside world or distribute it throughout the Zone, quite often through your... errr... barman. I hope my work has helped to save the lives of many stalkers. I was just transporting the results of my latest research to the laboratory near Amber when the helicopter came under fire.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_12">
		<text>Tell me about your understanding of the Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_121">
		<text>Well, in my opinion the Zone is a wonderful gift to humanity. Of course normal existence here is not possible due to the large number of adverse external factors: high radiation levels, anomalies, aggressive mutants and so on... All of these things are obviously potentially dangerous but they are simultaneously items of great scientific value. The Zone is... an experiment of truly gargantuan proportions! It's a unique opportunity to make a breakthrough in many fields of science! The extent to which humanity's knowledge could be increased through studying the Zone is unfathomable. Technology, medicine, new plants (medical and edible), biotechnology, cures for incurable diseases...anything! If only people didn't interfere science could lead humanity into a new Golden Era!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_1211">
		<text>However Duty thinks otherwise and even Freedom doesn't seem to want to help you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_12111">
		<text>You have to understand - they're simply incapable of grasping the whole picture in its entirety. For all stalkers, without exception, their current, personal, essentially irrelevant problems are far more important than the progress of humanity!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_1212">
		<text>I'm a stalker but I don't consider studying the Zone to be pointless.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_12121">
		<text>Then you understand? You also see the big picture? It's wonderful to discover that there are those among you who are not narrow-minded practical people. I've always said - it's important to look at the whole set of issues from a broader perspective, to distance ourselves from our emotions. I admit the Zone can do, and has done, harm to humanity but to reject the unique opportunities it offers would be utter nonsense!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_13">
		<text>Why are mercenaries looking for this information?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_131">
		<text>I hope this doesn't offend you... but many stalkers are in a way children - easily excitable and fickle. Just think of all these legends... about a Monolith that grants wishes. What a joke! Childish people are often annoyed about the fact that someone doesn't share everything with them, including information that is not meant for them. Unfortunately, they also have a tendency to use weapons without thinking... dangerous fools!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_14">
		<text>I am looking for laboratory X16. Could you tell me where it is?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_141">
		<text>Laboratory X16? Hmm… Sakharov mentioned something of the sort in passing but I do not recall exactly what he said. Perhaps you'd best ask him yourself... He's currently in the mobile lab by Amber.</text>

		<text>Mr. Stalker, I beg you! We were returning to the Amber sector when mercenaries shot down our helicopter. I believe they are looking for information which I have with me and they'll probably kill me once they have it. Help me get to the lake and I'll tell you everything I know about a device called... stalkers call it the Brain Burner. Further, I will ask the barman to pay you.</text>
