        <text>Received from Bugay: \n Grey, I've found out that the Mole's group has took off for the Agroprom factory. They're in search for the Gunslinger's cache, wishing to get wind of how he edged through to the North. We're supposed to know the approximate cache's spot. They'll camp at the factory during the search. Well, straight to the point. You're nearby - maybe you'd better go there and talk to them. You're a communicative person indeed - maybe you can draw out the information from them. Huh?\n \n Send to Bugay: \n Listen, Bugay, I haven't got a single sign of desire to poke in there. There are too many militaries. I don't really want to find myself ended life with the bullet in the head there. Though as I understand they'll return to the Bar later. And I'm going to camp at the Garages at the Dump. I have a task from the scientists on the bloodsuckers' heads. So when the Mole's grouping is coming back, I'll intercept them.</text>
