		<text>I, professor Kruglov, am deleting the results of our research. Dangerous knowledge must not pass into the hands of unreliable people who will seek to use it for the achievement of their criminal objectives. Those who read this note should know that our group was shot down above the Wild Territory by mercenaries led by a notorious cutthroat called Wolfhound. Be advised that by the time you read this we will probably be dead.</text>

		<text>... as it turns out, emissions affect primarily the advanced spheres of cognitive activity. Experiments show that only humans and animals with developed cognitive processes like dogs and horses are susceptible to these emissions. Of the above only humans enter a state of trance - in animals the effect is limited to a strong feeling of fear. Judging by this evidence, it would be reasonable to conclude that the emissions are geared specifically towards the human brain. Extensive studies on "volunteers" have shown that subjects will leave the trance state if given medicamental treatment. We also developed experimental devices that will protect the human brain from doses of these emissions. According to our calculations the source of these emissions is located in the centre of Amber Lake and the source itself is likely to be artificial in nature meaning it can be disabled. There is also the danger of criminals attempting to reach the source of emissions and gaining control over it.</text>

		<text>12.01.2012 \n God damn my bosses...won't leave an old man alone. First Black Mesa, then some strange town in Russia. And now the endless Ukrainian plains. Take your jemmy and have fun.  \n \n 20.03.2012 \n Made it into the Zone. Are there really no bears here? Who am I going to fight then? I'm not finding my bearings too well in this place. I had to give my little crowbar away for a can of meat. \n \n 26.04.2012 \n The emission has started. The barman told me to hide my ass and keep it hidden. I chased some rats out of an abandoned tunnel. I hope to wait out the bad weather in here.</text>
