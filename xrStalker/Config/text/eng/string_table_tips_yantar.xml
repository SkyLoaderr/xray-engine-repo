		<text>Listen, this prototype won't protect you from powerful emissions for long. I expected this, so every time an emission is detected, a timer is activated. When the time runs out, the prototype will no longer protect you, so be careful and keep an eye on the time.</text>

		<text>Great work, Marked One. The emission has been turned off and you're still alive. I need to warn you, however. We called in a couple of military helicopters to clear the area of zombies. You would be advised not to wander around unless you have to. Oh, and by the way, pop into our bunker every once in a while, won't you?</text>
