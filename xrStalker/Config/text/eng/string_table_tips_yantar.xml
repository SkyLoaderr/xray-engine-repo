		<text>Good man, Marked One, you made it to the lab in the end. It's extremely important that we study the machine in the lab. Try turning it off so that we can examine it.</text>

		<text>Listen, the prototype cannot protect you from powerful emissions for long. I expected this so if you encounter such emissions a timer will be activated. When time runs out the prototype will no longer be able to protect you. Be careful and keep an eye on the time.</text>

	<string id="yan_saharov_message_3">
		<text>Great work, Marked One. The emissions have bee turned off, you're alive. I want to warn you, we called a couple of military helicopters to clear the area of zombies so you best avoid it. Oh, by the way, if you're in the area pop into our bunker some time, won't you?</text>
