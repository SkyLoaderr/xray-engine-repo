        <text>I am shocked! Ghost and and a person on the picture in PDA, attached to the task "kill Gunslinger", \nis the same man. I don't understand anything. It means that some error happened. But who assumed \nit? There's no answer yet. And there's no time. Zombies are climbing from all cracks. On a dead \nbody I found instruction, how to disconnect plant: it is necessary to turn off three knife-switchs on \nthree tiers of this giant device. After that it will be possible to turn off a basic knife-switch on a basic \nstand on the third tier. The area of the most powerful radiation spreads only within the limits of \nsphere so I got not more than 1 minute for turning off one of knife-switchs – my defence will not stand \nit. So I must disconnect knife-switchs one by one, each time going back into a safe place out of \nsphere till expiration of this minute.</text>

        <text>So it is done with a «Psy-brain». The source of psy-radiation is turned off, and it was exactly it. All \nneighbourhood was under influencing of «psy-brain» plant- it zombified everyone, who was in the \narea of its action. I found out there is another plant in the laboratory of ?19 and probably it is «brain \nscorcher». I also found out, that these plants not always work on full power. There are periods when \nit lowers power of radiation for cooling its aggregates. As for Ghost. On a dead body I found the \nname of «common acquaintance» and fourth in a group of Gunslinger - Doctor. He helped for a long \ntime a group and executed, to all appearances, the role of «staff». It is possible to find him through \nstalker on a nickname «Guide» - which, often is on ? border. Well, Guide, look out of occasionally \ndying before we meet.</text>

        <text>Well, I almost in a step from one of the people of Gunslinger. Ghost went away in the underground \nlaboratory of ?16 with one of the scientist. There's just one "but" - I'll hardly find him alive. A scientist \nreturned from there alone and perished already on approach to the camp. Scientists gave me a \ncertain protective device for protecting from this unknown emanation. I hope it will justify itself. They \nwant me to worm into inward and turn off a source of emanation – so they will be able to study \neverything in this place. Well, God bless me..</text>
