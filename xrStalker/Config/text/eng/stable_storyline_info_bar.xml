        <text>I, professor Kruglov, in the name of science and humanity delete the reports of our researches. Unsafe knowledge mustn't get to the hands of malevolent \nelements, who will use them in their criminal aims. Those who read this note should know, that our group has been hit over the "wild territory" by Freedom \nanarchists, under command of famous cutthroat Wolfhound. And to the moment you are reading this note, we are most likely to be dead.</text>

        <text>... as it turned out to be, the radiation above all influences the higher spheres of thinking. The experienced showed that only human and animals with highly \norganized reasoning, such as dogs, horses, sensible to this emanation. Out of the elements abovementioned, only human is most subjected to deep into the \ntrance, the laboratory animals only suffered the great effect withing the bounds of fear. Basing upon these suppositions, we can make a conclusion about the \nspecialization of influencing exclusively human brain. The continual experiments on the "volunteers" proved that the trance effect can be palliated with \nmedicinally treatment. Also we've developed the experimental devices that protect the human brain from dosed emanation influence. According to our \ncalculations the source of radiation is situated in the center of Yantar lake, most probably the nature of the source is artificial and it's highly possible to \ndeactivate them. Also, there is a danger, that unreliable elements can gain access to the source of emanation and take it under it's control.</text>

        <text>I've Looked through documents which found soldieries in former SRI. The conclusion is: this institute, \nlast years, before the meltdown was the protection of non governmental laboratory ?-18, which to all \nappearances conducted a certain mysterious experiment. Where a laboratory is - the documents \nhas no answer. It looks like militaries don't know about it either. Yeah. There appear more riddles. \nBut it can be a filament which merchants may require. Well, now a there's a way coming farther on \na north, to the merchant on the name Barman.</text>

        <text>Yeah, it's a gloomy place this laboratory ?18... and its present dwellers...never even could think that \nsuch scums can exist in the world. I have found some documents. I understood a little from them \nthat there are certain technical specifications on some blocks to the emitters of Kaymanov. The fact \nis these blocks targeted at other laboratory which code is ?16 and to all appearances also is secret \none.</text>

    <string id="journal_bar_x16_documents">
        <text>Hemm, Merchants have really found out a lot of information as for these laboratories. It was a real \nsurprise for Barmen the information about emitters and about ?16. And he is sure now, that this \n«brain scorcher» is handmade. He thinks that this laboratory ?16 is not far from the camp of \nscientists near a lake Jantar. They are studying at this moment a radiation which has similar effect \nlike «scorcher». So now my way lies to scientific fraternity of the Zone.</text>

        <text>I've Met Barman. Having documents from Agroprom looked through, he assumed that this ?-18 \nwas in the so-called Dark Valley and offered to me to drop in there for the purpose of \ninformation and documents retrieval. He says he has sent Duty spies already with a task to get to \nthis cave. But they disappeared. A barman assumed that they became prisoners of the gangsters \nwhich have their base not far. And if it so, all that Duty spies found is the possession of the leader \nof gangsters - Hog. Barman, calls to the carefulness and obviously something holds back about \nthis cave. Well, all right, for a work: at first I have to talk to Hog, and if a «talk» will be \nsuccessful, then I go to the underground.</text>

I have to find enntrance into the underground bunker of laboratory ?19 and the \nway to the control room of the "brain scorcher's" antennas.</text>
