		<text>I, professor Kruglov, am deleted the results of our research for the sake of science and humanity as a whole. Dangerous knowledge must not pass into the hands of unreliable people who will seek to use it for the achievement of their criminal objectives. Those who read this note should know that our group was shot down above the Wild Territory by Freedom anarchists led by a notorious cutthroat called Wolfhound.

		<text>I looked through the documents found at the former Institute. The conclusion is that the Institute was used as a front for a non-state laboratory called X18 in the years preceding the accident. This lab appears to have been conducting some mysterious experiment; its location is not clear from the documents and the military don't seem to know anything about it either. Well, well... the puzzles are multiplying... But perhaps this is the starting point which the traders need. Now I have to travel further north to a trader known as the Barman.</text>

		<text>Hell... lab X18 wasn't fun...and its current residents...I didn't think things like that existed. I found some documents...I didn't understand much of what they contained except that they are technical specifications for some blocks from Kaimanov emitters. What's interesting is that the blocks were designated for another laboratory with the codename X16 and it's probably a secret one too.</text>

		<text>Hmm...The traders have dug up a lot of information about these laboratories. The Barman wasn't surprised to find out about the emitters and X16. Now he's convinced that this Brain Burner is man-made. He thinks that laboratory X16 is near the scientists' camp by Amber Lake. It's interesting that they're studying emissions that resemble the effects of the Burner. So now I must pay a visit to the Zone's scientific community.</text>

		<text>I met with the Barman. Having looked through the documents from the Institute he thinks that this X18 is in the so called Dark Valley and offered me to go there to look for information and documents. He says he sent Duty scouts to get into the underground vaults there but they disappeared. The Barman thinks they were captured by bandits who have a base nearby. If that's true everything those Duty guys found will be in the hands of Boar, the leader of the bandits. The Barman told me to be careful and... clearly didn't tell me everything about these underground vaults. Oh well, time to get to work: first of all I need to go pay Boar a visit and if the "conversation" goes well I'll explore the underground.</text>
