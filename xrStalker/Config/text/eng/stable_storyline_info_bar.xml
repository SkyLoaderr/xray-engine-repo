        <text>I, professor Kruglov, in the name of science and humanity delete the reports of our researches. Unsafe knowledge mustn't get to the hands of malevolent \nelements, who will use them in their criminal aims. Those who read this note should know, that our group has been hit over the "wild territory" by Freedom \nanarchists, under command of famous cutthroat Wolfhound. And to the moment you are reading this note, we are most likely to be dead.</text>

        <text>... as it turned out to be, the radiation above all influences the higher spheres of thinking. The experienced showed that only human and animals with highly \norganized reasoning, such as dogs, horses, sensible to this emanation. Out of the elements abovementioned, only human is most subjected to deep into the \ntrance, the laboratory animals only suffered the great effect withing the bounds of fear. Basing upon these suppositions, we can make a conclusion about the \nspecialization of influencing exclusively human brain. The continual experiments on the "volunteers" proved that the trance effect can be palliated with \nmedicinally treatment. Also we've developed the experimental devices that protect the human brain from dosed emanation influence. According to our \ncalculations the source of radiation is situated in the center of Yantar lake, most probably the nature of the source is artificial and it's highly possible to \ndeactivate them. Also, there is a danger, that unreliable elements can gain access to the source of emanation and take it under it's control.</text>

        <text>Barkeep: "We have one serious thing to do. There is a group of stalkers-veterans on the "wild territory" and recently the cases of single stalkers deaths \nbecame more frequent in their "region". Duty's people came to me and asked to deal with these veterans. Duty has irrefutable edivence of veterans' \nconnection to singles assassinations. The point is that Duty has an old treaty with them, which is impossible for them to be violated, while these guys are \nbecoming really impudent. To be short, Duty wants them to be taken out silently. The task is complex, but it is well paid. Duty is caring highly of their name. \nThus, they want to do everything silently. You're enough to eliminate their boss named "Lucky" and bring his PDA as a proof.</text>

        <text>Barkeep: "Stalkers have been interested in passage to the North, to the center, for a couple of years. But inasmuch as the passage is closed, and those who \npicked their way towards there haven't yet returned. There is an information about some kind of "brain scorcher", which blocks up the way to the North, but \nwhat kind of thing is that remains unknown. According to the documents, which you have fetched from Agroprom, something is becoming clear. It seems that \nthe "brain scorcher" has got an artificial nature. We need more data to tell more correctly. Lab X18 is mentioned in documents, which is said to be working on \nthis project. The descriptions meet the abandoned underground premises at Dark Valley, known as the "dark laboratory". It's necessary to search this \nlaboratory thoroughly. When Zone blew out, nobody had time to evacuate anything. For sure, a lot of stuff remained there. If you bring the document files \nabout the "antennas" or about the "oscillator", I'll pay you good. Besides, I'll share with you information on the oscillator. That's it. The task is dangerous, no \nquestions. What is happening there is unknown, moreover the Dark Valley has always been the unsafe place. So try to be really careful there."</text>
