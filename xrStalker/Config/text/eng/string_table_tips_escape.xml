	<string id="escape_fox_quest">
		<text>A word about Hawkeye, Marked One. A stalker just came back from a long raid. Fox he's called. Looks like he had a pretty rough time and he's asking for help. Some weird beasts followed him all the way back, he says he won't hold out much longer. I reckon the fella will know a bit about Hawkeye. Here are the coordinates. You might wanna hurry up though.</text>
