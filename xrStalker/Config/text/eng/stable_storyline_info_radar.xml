		<text>I turned off the Burner. For some reason, I lost conciousness just as I did it. Then, I had a dream: I saw again the massive Chernobyl power plant and the sarcophagus. Then a flash. The shining Monolith inside the sarcophagus. I understand that it is the Wish-Granting Machine. A stalker, exhausted and in rags, reaches feebly out to it...a bright flash and I see a fragment of the first dream... A man stands with his back to me and keeps shooting. Someone shouts, "Hawkeye!". The man shudders, freezes for a moment and then starts to turn slowly...but the pictures slide past, as if a film was played backwards, and I see how he uses his weapon to force the rats back into the station... I realize that I was there. I must go to the Monolith.</text>
