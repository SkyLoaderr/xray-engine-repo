        <text>This is the road to the Zone. One can find merchant in cellar near the army blockpost.

The planes are overcrowded by blind dogs, if I were a new one I would stay away from that place. Even mutants can sometimes be seen here.</text>

        <text>Need to bag an artifact. There is an accumulation of Elektra anomalies nearby, artifacts must be somewhere there. Bring any one to me – and we’re done.

        <text>Well bring the case – then we’ll have a deal. But I want to outmark that if you start killing soldiers, I will anounce you to be outlawed. I don’t need infinites here.

        <text>Protect, what else. Either the Zone or the world from the Zone, it is incomprehensible. Sometimes even military expeditions enter the zone. Searching for something, perhaps. Here what I can tell you. Militaries don’t respect the zone. Every now and then take away zinc coffins.</text>

    <string id="escape_trader_talk_flame_51">
        <text>Ye, there was such a person, one of Sniper gang. They went together to the center of the Zone. When all guys died there, Spectral was the only survival. I too would like to know where he is. But no one has no information on his whereabouts.</text>

        <text>Do you know stalker named Gray?\n\n*** After receiving Gray quest in the garage ***</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_flame_61">
        <text>Ye, he is a famous fellow, old-timer in the Zone. Brings exclusive artifacts, not some trinkets, but real staff, and brings them rather often. Grow pretty rich on it. I think he goes far deep into the Zone, maybe he even knows something about the Sniper.</text>

    <string id="escape_trader_talk_level_1">
        <text>Suburbs of the Zone, military cordon. Troops of blind dogs wonder around. From time to time other mutants drop in. But in general it is usually calm and quite here, just military guys have fun sometimes. Stalkers only pass by, only freshmen linger on. No worthy loot here. What else, there is a demolished bridge and an abandoned factory. That`s all, I guess.</text>

        <text>Few dozens of soldiers, they are allowed to shoot on sight. So you better pass them by. When military guys are too worried, start calling help from special forces. Those fellows are really tough. After their visits I have no clients for months. So you better not to disturb them. I know their commander a little. He is a total drunkard.

        <text>Further along the road inside the zone you&apos;ll find a railway embankment. It was once an expensive bridge, but had been destroyed during the surge. Militaries like to lie in wait for stalkers, returning with the bribe there.</text>

        <text>When you cross the road you&apos;ll see it. White building. Things that could be stolen had been stolen long ago, everything else became rusty. The favourite bandits&apos; place. There is a depression in the ground nearby that can provide one with artifacts.</text>
