        <text>Thanks for rescuing me. Bandits, rascals they are, wanted to pass me on to the Monolith gang. And those half-zombies are rumoured to feed stalkers to monsters infesting the secret laboratory under the Monolith base.</text>

        <text>Nobody knows, and the Monolith guys won't tell. I hear though bandits talking the Hog, their leader, possesses a counterpart key to the laboratory. But reaching the Hog is totally out of the question - his guards are utterly tough boys. Oh! I just remembered! I heard Serega crying out loud!</text>

    <string id="val_escort_captive_dialog_11111">
        <text>Well, if the bandits have it this tough, I definitely could do with a teammate.</text>

        <text>He's another fighter of ours. I thought he hadn't made it, but when I was escorted down the road, I heard cries for help from the basement. That was him for sure. You're great in fighting, set him free.</text>

    </string>
    <string id="val_escort_captive_dialog_44">
        <text>"Simply"! Provided it's not hard to get a suit in the bandit camp, finding out the password is next to impossible a task. None of the bandits will pour out to you. I hear bandits talking that the pass is also stored on PDA of Hog, bandits' leader, but he's completely impossible to reach - his guards are tough boys.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="val_escort_captive_dialog_444">
        <text>OK, thanks for the information.</text>

        <text>Stalker, help us freeing a friend. "Duty" sent our scout group of three here, but we faced a bandit ambush on the way back.

        <text>Thanks, brother. We pulled out my teammate. Hold the award, well deserved.</text>

        <text>The award is good, no doubt, but I could do with some help really. Will you go with me?</text>

        <text>Deal.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="val_escort_nap1_dialog_212">
        <text>You did some scouting around here, didn't you? What's interesting here in this area?</text>

    <string id="val_escort_nap1_dialog_2121">
        <text>To the north there's a camp of bandits. To the east you'll locate the base of Monolith. To the south-west there's a neglected pig farm. There are also some gates nearby there.</text>

    <string id="val_escort_nap1_dialog_21211">
        <text>Any more details on the bandit camp?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="val_escort_nap1_dialog_212111">
        <text>Bandits are based in the underconstructed building. Their leader is a brutal bastard named Hog. From the general perspective, he managed to get in contact with the Monolith guys and sends stalker captives to the Monolith base now and then. What for - I have no idea.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="val_escort_nap1_dialog_21212">
        <text>What's going on there on the Monolith base?</text>
    </string>

        <text>We found out that on the Monolith base there is an entrance to underground laboratory and it is the entrance which these crazy geeks are protecting.

    </string>
    <string id="val_escort_nap1_dialog_2121211">
        <text>What laboratory? What's inside there?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="val_escort_nap1_dialog_21212111">
        <text>Now this is beyond me, we never made it inside. The only thing we found out - it's constantly closed. I heard from a bandit talk that the Hog, their leader, has somehow grabbed a counterpart key. Most likely he's about to intrude there himself.</text>

    <string id="val_escort_nap1_dialog_21213">
        <text>Pig farm? Are there any pigs there too?</text>

        <text>He-he, desperate for a stake? You are not in a restaurant, bro. Though, if you are up to some tasty pork, all around the Zone there're pigs, shining with radiation. Once you eat one of those, no more need for a torch in the night, you'll be radiating the light yourself! The pig farm is in limbo, some stalkers are queening around there. I didn't like them though, and I tell you, I trust my inner senses.</text>

        <text>Can't get it really. The gates are closed, guarded by the Monolith gang. Sometimes lorries come from there to the Monolith base. That's all I know.</text>
