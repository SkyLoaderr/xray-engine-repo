        <text>Oh! I've been here for so long. I may say from the very beginning. There was nothing then - not a single grouping, no militaries - only monsters and me. Quite a number died by my hand... well... hands. Remember myself fighting with TEN bloodsuckers at once!!!</text>

        <text>I've sent one of my guys to blow up the fence. But either it was for a good sniper or it was just an unlucky day, well he was done in. So the explosives are now set on the fence, nonetheless we can't manage to blow it up.</text>

        <text>What will my share be?</text>

        <text>This is the correct approach to the case. You'll get 2000 from us and a lots of equipment on the base - there should be a lot of corpses, I promise you. You'll both help us and will remain satisfied. So what?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="mil_dolg_skull_dialog_120">
        <text>Okay, if raise it to 2500... And one more thing... The life is full of surprises, so let's do it this way - I'll sweep away the sniper and get 1500, and after the battle - 1000.</text>

        <text>So, you have done in the sniper. Now we'll blow up the fence and start the party. As far as you have a good aiming your task is to deal with the snipers on the towers. While without snipers it will be a lot easier to get that scum - Lucash.</text>

    <string id="mil_freedom_commander_1005">
        <text>I'll tell you the truth - badly. Something is going on in the center of the Zone, monsters are crowding out there. We've lost two more guys recently, so you're just in time. Trembling, don't you?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="mil_freedom_commander_1006">
        <text>Now way. I'm not a boy though. So to say - "Good monster - dead monster".</text>

        <text>That's correct. Okay, now straight to the point. Scout has returned and reported that he haven't seen that amount of monsters even in the worst dreams, he couldn't even tot them up. So it'll be really hot in here next night.</text>

        <text>You're right. Even though we'll have to encounter humans, if those can be treated as the ones. Monolithians groups are attempting to break through time to time. I hope they won't be here with the monsters.</text>

        <text>We call it "Barrier". And actually it is the one. This is the last remaining civilized armypost in the Zone, buffer between humans and feral territory.</text>

        <text>Further is death. Well, or the lot to "serve monolith" - My monolith! In your name! Bla - bla - bla. In short I wouldn't advise you to go there.

        <text>Who else if not we? Duty? Well they are truly experts as to the expermination, crusification and dispatching the monsters. But they will never do anything for the others, can you see them here? No? Me either. Strange... Moreover we haven't set a goal to extirpate the creatures inhabiting the Zone, while we realize the necessity of the barrier - line which shouldn't be stepped over by neither side, otherwise it may lead to unpredictable consequences.</text>

        <text>Hem. You'd better intercept him untill he reaches the village near to the passage to Dead city. He's likely to be awaited there and I don't think you'll be able to cope with them all.

        <text>Some guy is hiding at the bogs, he’s one of ours. He’s gone mad after visiting village and nobody can approach him now.

        <text>Village? A loathsome place. It was formerly inhabited by boars, dogs, fleshes, in general - all small fry. We've been visiting it for the artifacts. Now only few know what's going on there. Bloodsukers appeared from nowhere, this is for certain, it can be really fatal to poke nose there at night. Our last expedition has perished with its full complement, excluding one guy, who had his mind lost from then on.</text>

    </string>
    <string id="mil_max_dialog_common2_5">
        <text>It has once been a lake full of fish and now it's turned into a swamp. Not a childish radiation in there, none of the protection suits helps. The last one who nosed around there died tormented from the dose received.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="mil_max_dialog_common2_6">
        <text>Why has he been nosing around the swamp?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="mil_max_dialog_common2_7">
        <text>One guy camps there, without any sign of noddle. Survived the village at night, then he went off the candle. He's apparently a lucky person, since soldiers have mined almost everything in there, but he made his way to the house and still sits there, shooting off everything that comes nearby.</text>

    </string>
    <string id="mil_max_dialog_common2_80">
        <text>To the east from the base. But you ought to avoid that place as the pseudogiants have inhabited that place. They can attempt to have you on the lunch.</text>

        <text>And where are these roads leading to?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="mil_max_dialog_common2_90">
        <text>They can get you to Rostok, but perhaps it's where you've come from. Pass to Radar to the North, but there are few who travel there - nobody wants to finish their lives by way of the plant. The road to the East leads to Dead city - mercenaries are there, they shoot everyone they see, however there is something to satisfy them with.</text>

    <string id="mil_max_dialog_common3_0">
        <text>And where can I buy ammunition nearby, or a gun?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="mil_max_dialog_common3_1">
        <text>In the main building, on the ground floor, there is a Skinflint sitting to the left. He's in charge for trade. You can even offer him artifacts.</text>

        <text>Well, yes and no. In fact we're waiting when something happens with this damn radiation or what a hell it is at Radar. We are the first to reach the promised land then. Plenty of artefacts and booty will provide a worthy life when we retire.</text>

        <text>Sure. It's Kep and his "paladins" who's here for noble aims comprehensible only for him. And we? We are just ordinary guys, who want to live the way we do.

        <text>I've got a floorer - where can I find artifacts, weapons?</text>

    <string id="mil_trader_dialog_1003">
        <text>I've got some, for money. Or you can find some in the village for free, but the risks are higher.</text>

        <text>Village?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="mil_trader_dialog_1005">
        <text>Village. There are heaps of anomalies there and novices often trap into them. Our guys went there - join them, if you want.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="mil_trader_dialog_1006">
        <text>Clear.</text>

        <text>I want to ask where I can get some artifacts?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="mil_trader_dialog_3003">
        <text>In the same place as usual - in anomalies. What kind of bozo you are! But... there's some variants.</text>

    <string id="mil_trader_dialog_3004">
        <text>Read out the list.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="mil_trader_dialog_3005">
        <text>First clause is comprehensible - anomalies are the key. Second - I can give you a "Crystal", if you do me a favour...</text>

    <string id="mil_trader_dialog_3006">
        <text>What favour?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="mil_trader_dialog_3007">
        <text>My fearful fellas can't fetch any artifact from the village. They say some beast inhabits it. When you clear up the situation you'll get a "Crystal" from me.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="mil_trader_dialog_3008">
        <text>Is it so bad?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="mil_trader_dialog_3009">
        <text>It is even worse. They reported a couple of guys took off to a village and haven't returned. And another three are sitting nearby there. Fortune favors the bold, damn it.</text>

    <string id="mil_trader_dialog_3010">
        <text>I see, I guess I'll take a walk there...</text>

        <text>That's a horse of a different color. When you find something - I buy it at a good price.</text>

        <text>They are sitting looking around...</text>

    <string id="mil_trader_dialog_3111">
        <text>Well, if you help them in hunt, I'll give you an artifact "Crystall flower". What can you say?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="mil_trader_dialog_3200">
        <text>We talked and went along the village to catch some kind of mutant...</text>

        <text>So, what? Don't beat about the bush!</text>
    </string>
    <string id="mil_trader_dialog_3300">
        <text>We butchered some beast but guys are dead. As we approached water-tower they grasped their hands and I got a bloody mirage before my eyes... This \nbeast effects one's brain. I shot it, but it didn't help guys.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="mil_trader_dialog_3301">
        <text>Awfull... Gloomy was a skillful stalker. It's a pity. OK, take this artifact for you helped guys.</text>

        <text>The guys went hunting, I came back here...</text>

        <text>How was the hunt?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="mil_trader_dialog_4002">
        <text>Bad. This creature effects one's brain. The guys are dead...</text>

    <string id="mil_trader_dialog_4003">
        <text>How?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="mil_trader_dialog_4004">
        <text>Fist it was everything ok, as we reached the water-tower it something happened to them. They threw weapons and grasped their heads. I got a a bloody \nmirage before my eyes as this beast appeared. Human alike in some shabby clothes. I hardly killed it. As this beast croaked the guyes died too. Maybe it \neffects on their brains... I feel bad until now...\n</text>

    <string id="mil_trader_dialog_4005">
        <text>Damn it... Gloomy was skillful stalker. It's a pity. OK, here is you reward.</text>

        <text>So you failed the mission... You won't get an artifact.</text>

        <text>Murmuring ?</text>

        <text>Exactly. Finished drunkard he is. Be it not for his cooking talent, he would be expelled from the base long ago. Find him at the kitchen. I'll give you a hint - you should locate him easily.</text>
