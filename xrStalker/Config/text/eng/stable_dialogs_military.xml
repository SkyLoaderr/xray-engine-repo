        <text>Village? Loathsome place. It was formerly occupied by boars, dogs, fleshes, in general - small fry. We've been visiting  it for the artifacts. Now only few know what's going on there. Bloodsukers appeared from nowhere, this is certain, well, it can be really fatal to poke nose there at night.

        <text>Swamp? And what is within?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="mil_max_dialog_common2_5">
        <text>It has once been the lake, fish was found in the river, and now it's turned into the swamp. Not a childish radiation in there, none of the defenses helps. The last one who nosed around there died tormented for the dose received.</text>

    <string id="mil_max_dialog_common2_6">
        <text>Why has he been nosing around the swamp?</text>

        <text>One guy camps there, without any signs of noddle. Survivor from the village at night, then he lost his noddle. He's apparently a lucky person, as the soldiers has mined allmost everything in there, but he made his way to the house, and still occupies it, shooting off everything that comes nearby.</text>

        <text>They can get you to Rostok, byt perhaps it's where you've come from. Pass to Radar to the North, but there are few who travel there - nobody wants to finish their lives as the plant.

        <text>Well, yes and no. In fact we're waiting when something happens with this damn radiation or what a hell it is at Radar. We are the first to reach the promised land then. Plenty of artefacts and booty will provideprovide a worthy life when we retire.</text>

        <text>Sure. It's Kep and his "paladins" who's here for only for him comprehensible noble aims.And we? We are just ordinary guys, who want to live the way we do.
