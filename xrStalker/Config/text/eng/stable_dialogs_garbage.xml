	<string id="escape_talk_about_garbage__10">
		<text>It's a big stinky dump, where piles of radioactive trash was brought after the accident of 1986...
		Smashed cranes, vehicles... You can locate rubble of old structures. Mutants can be encountered too. 
		Most frequently newbies roam around here, and, well, bandits - you can“t do without those. Small 
		artefacts can be found, but you'd better not stay here for long. Further there are loads of radiation 
		spots, impassable without protection.</text>

	<string id="escape_talk_about_garbage__21">
		<text>If you go southwards from the Dump, you can reach the Zone border and army post, 
		if you go along the dump to the north, you'll get to the stalker bar, to the west lies 
		Agroprom area, while the Dark valley is in the east.</text>
