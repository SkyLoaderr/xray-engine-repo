		<text>Why?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_1111">
		<text>Because that's our territory - Duty territory; and we're very picky about who we let through into our base. If you don't have anything important to discuss with our leaders you ain't getting past here.</text>

	<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_11111">
		<text>I see.</text>

	<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_111111">

	<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_11112">
		<text>I need to go there, I have some business with the barman.</text>

		<text>What's the favour?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_11112121">
		<text>Nothing much. There is a herd of boars wandering nearby that needs to be killed. Take 'em out and consider your passage paid for.</text>

	</string>
	<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_222">
		<text>Yeah, I killed them all.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_dolg_blokpost_2221">
		<text>OK, go on and say "hi" to the barman from me.</text>
	</string>

		<text>OK.</text>

		<text>We're trying to clear the Dump of bandits. My friends are waiting for a bandit raid nearby. We're trying to stop them because if they take control of the Dump nobody will be able to go deep into the Zone. Talk to our commander, he's not far from here at the vehicle graveyard with his boys. I'm going there myself - we could go together if you want.</text>

	<string id="gar_dramm_novice_start_21">
		<text>Let's go.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_dramm_novice_start_3">
		<text>Can you tell me anything about the Dump?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_dramm_novice_start_31">
		<text>There ain't much to tell, mate. The Dump is...a dump. Duty fighters guard the northern road to the Bar. You might want to avoid them - Duty is full of some real nasty types. To the right are the paths into the Dark Valley but the radiation is very powerful there. A little closer is the Grimpen Mire - marshes full of anomalies. Rumour has it that you are very likely to find some decent artifacts there but even more likely to find a lot of trouble. Oh well, at least there ain't no Hounds of the Baskervilles in the Mire!</text>

	<string id="gar_dramm_novice_start_311">
		<text>Go on.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_dramm_novice_start_3111">
		<text>To the right, by the marshes, there's a secret hiding place. You'll see a metallic construction overhanging a puddle. My stash is right below it…I put it there a while ago but you saved my life and you probably need it more anyway. So feel free to use it</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_dramm_novice_start_31111">
		<text>Thanks mate, that's useful info.</text>

	<string id="gar_hellcar_start_11">
		<text>Hey stalker, you're just in time! We really need your help. Those bandit bastards are trying to take control of the Dump. We had a shootout here half an hour ago and managed to take down three of the dogs. The others retreated but they're blatantly gonna come back with reinforcements any minute now. There aren't many of us and another man wouldn't hurt.</text>

		<text>Go on.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_hellcar_start_1111">

	<string id="gar_hellcar_start_31113">
		<text>Tell me about yourself.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_hellcar_start_311131">
		<text>Around here they called me Demon. I came to these parts three years ago. Like many of the guys in the Zone I'm a fugitive, wanted for two murders and GBH. A few years ago a mate of mine was battered pretty badly in another area - they had to literally put him back together at the hospital. I paid the bastards who did it a little "visit". When the coppers showed up I had to shoot one of them and jump out of a second-floor window - I've been here since. I've done well in this place but the list of my crimes has got a little longer too. I try to fight lawlessness just as I did on the outside, I train up rookies and teach them to survive in the Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_hellcar_start_3111311">
		<text>So why don't you join Duty if you feel that way?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_hellcar_start_31113111">
		<text>Duty fights against the Zone, I fight for the people. Besides, they're too closely linked with the government and the army. I don't want to wake up in detention one day.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_hellcar_start_311131111">
		<text>Good luck to you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_hellcar_start_31114">
		<text>What's the place?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_hellcar_start_311141">
		<text>The Dump. We'll be right at home here. You see those heaps of crap? You don't want to go there as they're so full of radioactive waste that a Geiger counter goes off the scale. The only decent way into the Zone is here and bandits have been increasingly active here lately. They're shit scared of going deeper into the Zone like experienced stalkers - that's \nDuty territory; but those hyenas love robbing the rookies here. So, if nobody else cares, we have to stand our ground and fight.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_hellcar_start_3111411">
		<text>Go on.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_hellcar_start_31114111">
		<text>That's my outlook on life. Everywhere, and especially here, you gotta act like a man, not some animal that is driven only by greed.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_hellcar_start_311141112">
		<text>Are there any large buildings in the Dump?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_hellcar_start_3111411121">
		<text>There's a big abandoned hangar in the centre which is pretty quiet - you can even stay the night there if you really have to. If you go west, towards the Institute, you'll find the bandit's camp. That's where the bastards we killed earlier came from and I doubt that's the end of that.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_hellcar_start_31114111211">
		<text>Thank you.</text>

	<string id="gar_seriy_start_4411">
		<text>You can find a lot of trouble real quick, that's for sure. But if you're such an explorer I'll tell you what I know. To the east is a little forest. There's nothing interesting there but it's full of dogs. Be careful. If you follow this railway track it will lead you to the tunnel. There are lots of anomalies there; maybe something else too but I don't know - never really looked very hard. You probably know about the Duty checkpoint in the north.

		<text>Can you tell me anything about this place?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gar_stalker_about_level_1">
		<text>Well, at the moment we're standing in a big stinking dump. After the accident in 1986 they brought radioactive waste, cranes and destroyed vehicles here. Basically, it's full of useless crap and a few anomalies here and there. You can even find artifacts here but they're not good ones so that's why you'll mostly find rookies in this place. Lots of rookies means lots of bandits so it's best not to hang around. Further to the east there are loads of radiation pockets; you can't go there without protection. As you move to the south you'll reach the Zone's border. Go north and you'll eventually reach Rostok factory where you'll have no trouble finding the stalker bar. To the east is the Dark Valley, a gloomy place permanently saturated with mist. To the west is the Agroprom R&D Institute. I'll mark safe pathways on your map.</text>
