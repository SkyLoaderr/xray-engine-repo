        <text>Put a picture of this place for me.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="agr_stalker_talk_level_1">
        <text>This is the “Agroprom” institute. The structure itself is situated in the south-west. And the large factory on the North – this is the institute’s production and technical base. Building have been abandoned long ago, and people have stopped thinking about it, cos there is nothing left to steal. But recently militaries started to search something there.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="agr_stalker_talk_level_2">
        <text>Give me more specific information on the institute.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="agr_stalker_talk_level_21">
        <text>Rumors say that until the accident in 1986 it was the single Gramineae selection and genetics institute building. Also there were experimental fields at the factory place. After the accident institute has been closed and the fields were burned. And then remembered, whitewashed the building, fenced in and built barracks. Constructed factory on the fields place. I don’t know what were they doing in that institute, but it’s obvious that they spent money left and right.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="agr_stalker_talk_level_3">
        <text>Give me more detailed info on the factory.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="agr_stalker_talk_level_31">
        <text>Factory has been built at the end of 80th. Supposed to construct and mend the machines, which can treat the radioactively infected soil. But as far as I know, no one has seen such a machine. Now it’s totally tenantless. Only stalkers like to stay at there. It’s said that it’s rather safe place, if not to peep into the dark corners.</text>

    </string>
    <string id="esc_stalker_talk_level_1">
        <text>This is the road inside the Zone. Trader can be found in the cellar beyond the village near the army post. I don’t advise you to poke your nose in the army post, cos soldiers are directed to fire on sight… Killing soldiers isn’t allowed, only if worst comes to worst, trader will pay off on his own and he won’t be satisfied with that. Packs of blind dogs on the plains, perilously for the newbies. Mutants visit it now and then.</text>

    </string>
    <string id="escape_factory_assault_hello_2">
        <text>You are supposed to be that guy Wolf has been talking about? Well it’s up to you now, basically there are not so many bandits there. Although we can hardly penetrate it together. Sniper has settled on the first floor staring at all passing nearby. If it were not for him – we would punish them swiftly.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_factory_assault_hello_3">
        <text>So, will you take out the sniper? In other way we won’t poke a sinlge nose there. At least soberly.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_factory_assault_talk_0">
        <text>Now, gentlemen, what would you say?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_factory_assault_talk_1">
        <text>All standing. Bandits are still at the ruins. Few people plus sentry on the first floor.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_factory_assault_talk_11">
        <text>I suggest attacking the factory altogether.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_factory_assault_talk_111">
        <text>No way we will have felt this on our own skins. But don’t think that we’re afraid of. We aren’t scared at all. Unless occasionally… maybe it’s a bit scary now… well, okay, we are afraid. And won’t you be afraid of soberly penetrating the factory with the dug in bandits inside? And that sniper there. I’d say that vodka can encourage us, in other way it’s impossible.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_factory_assault_talk_112">
        <text>Oh, I see that you’ve brought “fire-water”. Well if it continues as it is, we’ll not only drive all the bandits away from the factory, but even clear the whole Zone! So, attack?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_factory_assault_talk_1121">
        <text>Well, I’ll tell you when. Now take this bottle.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_factory_assault_talk_1122">
        <text>Wait a second. “Fire-water” isn’t for you.</text>

        <text>Okay.</text>

    <string id="escape_fox_flame_dialog_2">
        <text>Fox, tell me whether you have been to the Zone. What have you seen?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_fox_flame_dialog_21">
        <text>Such a story may take a few days to tell, and my time costs a lot. Can only give you a piece of advice. "Dump" – located 3 kilometers to the North from where I stand, where all the radioactive trash had been taken to from stations in 86th. Heavy radiation, host of anomalies, and ultimately – abundance of artifacts, admittedly not valuable. Beware of the bandits and try not to swear at “Duty” patrols. Scientific research institute “Agroprom” is to the west from the “Dump”. Region is quite poor regarding the artifacts, so I don’t go there often. “Dark Valley” to the east. Sort of weird place. Like it’s rather quiet in there, but bandits and stuff can now and then be met. Yet I sense that not everything is so simple there as it seems. Further beyond the Dump is “Rostok” factory territory – stalkership heart. Besides many experienced guys you can come across with.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_fox_flame_dialog_211">
        <text>What do one have to beware of in these lands?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_fox_flame_dialog_2111">
        <text>Hey, Marked, you look like an experienced guy, but for such foolish questions. Be wary of everything! This is the bloody Zone, can’t you see?! However bloodsuckers appeared at the night on the Dump, they haven’t been seen so far away from the center. Eerie vermins. It’s quite hard to see them during the day, if not to mention the night.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_fox_flame_dialog_3">
        <text>Trader said that you can know something about the Gunslinger.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_fox_flame_dialog_31">
        <text>Many have been interested in him recently. Truthfully I don’t know him personally. But I do have err.. “contact” experience. His grouping has once fired upon my boys. No one was hurt – they’ve been probably waiting for the other ones, thus I consider it to me a misunderstanding. Fouled each other over the ravine and left. O, by the way, Grey is waiting for me at the garage at the Dump, I’ll send you the coordinates, chat with him. We knows a lot more.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_fox_flash_dialog_0">
        <text>I’m from the trader, you have to hand something to him.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_fox_flash_dialog_1">
        <text>Take it, and try not to lose. Important information.</text>

        <text>Hey, I’m waiting for a man here, so you’d better to get out of here sooner the better.</text>

    <string id="escape_lager_access_1">
        <text>One has to be a total dunce to let a man from the “death truck” in. First prove that you can be trusted.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_access_11">
        <text>What’s the “death truck”? I can’t remember anything.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_access_111">
        <text>I know few, but this few is something really really bad. Ultimately talking on this topic, especially with you, is not what I’m gonna do. Call it superstition if you wish. So begone, Marked, in an amicable way.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_access_12">
        <text>What must I do to make you believe me?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_access_121">
        <text>The trader must examine you, and we’ll just get acquainted. If you are a normal one, don’t grip the gun naively and generally familiar with your reason, we’ll find common language.</text>

    <string id="escape_lager_guard_start_dialog_2">
        <text>Marked, stop, there is no way for you to the camp now!</text>

        <text>Hi, Marked. What do you need?</text>

    <string id="escape_lager_hlam_hello_0">
        <text>Greetings. Wish to sell something?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_hlam_talk_people_0">
        <text>You are familiar with majority here. What has this crowd gathered here for?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_hlam_talk_people_1">
        <text>Yeah, it’s hard to say unambiguously, from doctors of science to laid-back bandits. Everyone receives the task to its wit. Militaries usually guard the perimeter, rarely entering the Zone. Bandits are settled on the stalkers’ paths. May bereave of bribe or even life. Scientists are set somewhere deep inside it, searching for the bloody truth, idiots! There are several stalkers’ clans, but that’s another matter. People here in the camp are rather quiet and peaceful this is understood – freshly, anxious newbies. Unless the “Wolf” is familiar in here. This one has seen a lot, but to my mind he’s a bit freaky with stalkership and all, he wants to cut off.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_hlam_talk_people_10">
        <text>Thanks.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_hlam_talk_people_2">
        <text>You’ve mentioned some stalkers’ clans. Can you give more specified information?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_hlam_talk_people_21">
        <text>You see, it’s really hard to survive in the Zone by yourself. So such clans are gathering here and there. Some for convictions, some for money. But there are lots of free stalkers, as I am. Everyone is free to chose: join someone or act alone on own hazard and fear. Concerning groupings I can give roundup on the “Duty”, “Mercenaries” and “Monolith”</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_hlam_talk_people_3">
        <text>Concerning the bandits. Why not to perish them once and for all? Admittedly everyone has weapons.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_hlam_talk_people_31">
        <text>Well, generally we’re trying to do that. But if ones are shot, another come.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_hlam_talk_people_4">
        <text>Tell me about the “Duty” grouping.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_hlam_talk_people_41">
        <text>These consider themselves to be Zone hags. They think that the Zone is the malignant growth on the Earth body, and going to clear the Earth from the Zone and its inhabitants, haven’t yet decided how indeed. Thus shot all the mutants without distinction.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_hlam_talk_people_5">
        <text>Tell me about the “Mercanaries” grouping.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_hlam_talk_people_51">
        <text>Generally those have gathered there are not satisfied by the war in the “outer world”. Extreme Zone conditions shooting enthusiasts. Ready to fulfil any, even the most dirty work. Well equipped, by occidental weapons in majority.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_hlam_talk_people_6">
        <text>Tell me about the “Monolith” grouping.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_hlam_talk_people_61">
        <text>Why they’re kind of strange ones. Don’t gather artifacts. Don’t make any liaisons. Don’t trade. Believe in some crap like aliens and evolutional module inside the center of the zone, which shall change the civilization on the earth for good. But these are rumors. I haven’t had personal contacts with them.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_hlam_talk_people_611">
        <text>And do you yourself believe in something? What’s in the center of Zone?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_hlam_talk_people_6111">
        <text>I believe that even the most intimate dreams are granted in the center of the Zone. But I don’t have a clue what’s in there. I trust that some day I will be able to make it there.</text>

        <text>Hello. I was told that you had saved one of ours from mere death. Thanks, man. Take this artifact as the sign of our gratitude. You can exchange it at Trader’s on weapons, shell or food.</text>

    <string id="escape_lager_volk_info_0">
        <text>Got a few questions.</text>
    </string>

        <text>Shoot. I’ll do my best to help ya.</text>

        <text>What’s inside the Zone?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_volk_info_2111">
        <text>This is the very question, which I wanted to find the answer to last two years. But the safe path to the center of the Zone hasn’t been found yet. Several times I tried to break through with my friends. I have hardly made it to return, my friends haven’t. If you ask how we got there, I’ll tell ya that we were seeking for the dream, for the wish master.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_volk_info_21111">
        <text>Why do you think that the dreams are to come true there?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_volk_info_211111">
        <text>There is a stalkers’ legend of the “wish master”. A place located in the center of the Zone, where all, even the most incredible, wishes come true. But you know what I’ll tell ya, I do know that there is the mere death in the center of the Zone, and that “master” is noteworthy. So, don’t run risks in vain.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_volk_info_212">
        <text>Where has the Zone come from?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_volk_info_2121">
        <text>Well, something boomed in 2006. Then it came. I know that this is barely an answer, but believe me that the truth is clear to very few.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_volk_info_213">
        <text>What has led you inside the Zone?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_volk_info_2131">
        <text>You unprofitable mine has been closed in 2008. Insufficient money. Then the rumors came about the Zone to give a chance to grow rich. I had no lack of army experience, so I ventured to do it. I can’t say that I an extremely rich now, but I’ve got a fair bit of brass behind my back. Typical story, as well as many others.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_volk_info_214">
        <text>What’s the most dangerous in the Zone?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_lager_volk_info_2141">
        <text>Well, it’s hard to say. There are so many things still dangerous and unknown that I’ve hardly seen the whole enchilada. My body is the vivid example of the Zone’s dangers: bit off toe, thinned hair over the radiation, right hip burnt in “Zharka”, bloody thing by the way. Anomaly which isn’t standing on the same place, but flying. Had a face to face contact with the bloodsucker once. I dread even recollecting it. Basically we can talk it through and through, but if you haven’t felt it on your skin – you won’t understand. Just one advice – be careful.</text>

        <text>Kind of tough stalker to my mind. Not really familiar with him. However I’ve been wandering at the center of the Zone too long ago, and here to the boundsthere are quite a lot of newbies. You ought to talk to somebody working in the depth of the Zone.</text>

By the way if there will be no artifacts, just wait until someone traps into the anomaly, dog of human, doesn’t matter. Anomaly will make artifact out of him in a moment.</text>

        <text>Î! That’s how we do that. Listen then: \n There is the “Mincer” anomaly field nearby. And the artifact in the center. Local novices from the camp are afraid to poke in there. Well it’s scattered somewhere there for about a week. It’s written all over your face that you’re not a newbie, although you remember nothing. So even in such condition you’ll manage to bag it. Okay. Get to the job. I’ve sent the coordinates of that place to your PDA along with the information on the Mincer and its artifacts.</text>

        <text>I need answers on several questions.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_1">
        <text>Shoot, but I know few. You see, I’m stuck here for the eternity, while the real life is outside in the Zone.</text>

    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_10">
        <text>Thanks for the information.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_2">
        <text>What are the militaries doing in the Zone?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_21">
        <text>Military guard it, what else can they do. The one thing I don’t get is whether they protect outside world form the Zone, or Zone from the outside world. Yep, I still don`t get it. Military expeditions sometimes come here. Must be searching for something. But I tell you, military men do not respect the Zone, and Zone pays back the same. Lots of then found they dead end here. Yep, dead.\nWhat, tell more? Well, those guys look down on us all, like some kind of supreme beings. Don`t give a damn about stalker laws, never help, even in the worst possible situation. No, lying, they can soot you, but not out of pity. Its just runs in their blood: Shoot first, think later. But I and they deal pretty well. Vodka, men magazines, in exchange for my private peace. So I advise you not to bother them in vain.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_3">
        <text>Tell me about the Zone.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_31">
        <text>Zone... is not just a peace of territory 40 kilometers in diameter, with its center near the nuclear plant. Zone is really strange being. I don`t think there is a person in this world who can give you a definite answer on your question. Because Zone is something not from this reality. I think it`s another world. Dangerous, strange, but, damn, it`s attractive. It`s like Eldorado, there even the most miserable bum can became very, very rich. And the deeper you go into the Zone, the closer you come to your fortune.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_311">
        <text>And what’s so dangerous in this “other world”?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_3111">
        <text>He, he. Nothing dangerous, besides that you can die any second. And not from the bullet of stupid military, by the way there are a lot of this guys lately. Must also tell, that be killed with a shot is the nicest death here. Really nice, compared with dying in anomaly - invisible death is the scariest one. Even mutants try to avoid them. Mutants, yes, “children” of the Zone. \nNasty creatures, tell ya. So you better don`t go to the Zone without a gun. And talk to stalkers, they are good advisers as for the Zone.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_312">
        <text>Rich? I would like to know more about getting rich...</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_3121">
        <text>Dude, don`t tell me you know nothing about artifacts. They are the source of your wealth. People outside pay good dough for these souvenirs form the Zone. They are more dear then gold and diamonds. Because no gold can draw aside bullet that heads right into your belly. And artifacts do this, and many other funny and useful things. You can get most common ones even here, but to find a treasure, you`ll have to go to heart the Zone.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_313">
        <text>And what lies there, in the heart of the Zone?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_3131">
        <text>People tell a lot, if interested, ask other stalkers. But I don`t believe in this mystic staff. I do believe that in the center of the Zone lies an Eldorado, a place rich in artifacts. But I met no people who could either confirm, or deny it.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_4">
        <text>Any ideas of what happened to me?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_41">
        <text>Son, you ask hell of questions. Everything is shady about it. You where found in the death truck - vehicles loaded with corpses sometimes appear from the center of the Zone. Where they head to, no one know. You truck crashed – bad luck, but you stayed alive. This is the most intriguing fact to me. Stalkers often find broken death trucks, but never found any survivals. Sorry, have nothing more to tell. You`ll have to figure it out yourself.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_5">
        <text>Who is Gunslinger? You know this guy?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_51">
        <text>I think I heard of this stalker. Rumors tell he is one of few, who got to the center of Zone. Well, there are a lot of legends about “stalker who made it to the center and back”. So, can`t guaranty the story is true, I personally had no business with him. Maybe he works with other dealers. Want to find him, ask stalkers, maybe some of them will tell you a way.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_6">
        <text>Spectral stalker, heard of him?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_info_61">
        <text>Its another legendary man. Not heard about him for a long time. He must have died somewhere deep in the Zone.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_level_0">
        <text>Tell me about this place.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_level_1">
        <text>Suburbs of the Zone, military cordon. In general it is usually calm and quite here, just military guys have fun sometimes. Stalkers only pass by, only freshmen linger on, and sometimes forever, hehe. There is the novices’ camp set nearby me in the village. They can pull the trigger sometimes though. No worthy loot here. Abandoned factory by the road. Farm remnants to the North, blockpost to the South. By the way, militaries has set landmines in some places, watch it. There has been the bridge in the center, but in has been ruined. That`s it, I guess.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_level_10">
        <text>Okay, thanks.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_level_2">
        <text>Tell me more on the army post.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_level_21">
        <text>Few dozens of soldiers, they are allowed to shoot on sight. So you better pass them by. When military guys are too worried, start calling help from special forces. Those fellows are really tough. After their visits I have no clients for months. So you better not to disturb them. I know their commander a little. He is a total drunkard. Only thanks to his I`m still here.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_level_3">
        <text>Tell me more about the ruined bridge.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_level_31">
        <text>300-400 meters to the North. You can’t miss it. It was once an expensive bridge, but had been destroyed during the surge. Militaries like to lie in wait for stalkers, returning with the bribe there. So you’d better avoid that embankment, if not crucial.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_level_4">
        <text>Give me the picture on the factory?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_talk_level_41">
        <text>As you cross the road, you’ll notice it. Ruined brick building. Everything that could be stolen, has already been stolen, so the only half-tumbled down core remains. The favorite bandits place. I am not aware if they’re still there, but in any case stay prudent. You’ve still got nothing to take away, but do you really need it?</text>

        <text>Generally speaking, “Agroprom” handed the thing I really need to the army post. White plastic case. It has to be stolen. Just be careful. When miliraties resent they make so much noise here, that even rats scatter. If I were you I would try to make it at night and as quiet as possible.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_done_gift_211">
        <text>What kinda case is it?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_done_gift_2111">
        <text>Nothing special in it. Plastic white grip-sack. Why I do need the very thing inside it. These documents – preliminary report on the military expedition to “Agroprom”.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_done_gift_21111">
        <text>Ok. I'll try.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="escape_trader_done_gift_211111">
        <text>Well bring the case first, then we'll deal with money.</text>

        <text>No, I don't agree.</text>

    <string id="gar_dolg_about_0">
        <text>Can you tell something interesting?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="gar_dolg_about_1">
        <text>I have a lot to tell. But possibly you’ve heard of that kinda vermin like mutants a lot. I can acquaint you with us, “Duty” grouping. But don’t you dare to ask me about those morons from “Freedom”.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="gar_dolg_about_2">
        <text>Tell me about your grouping.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="gar_dolg_about_21">
        <text>We’ve been here from the very beginning. The grouping itself has been found by the toughies from one of special task forces, sent in the Zone to investigate the full picture of its appearance. We got into a serious scrape there. After the half of our troops has perished under the terrible circumstances, the ones survived swore that wouldn’t leave until they coped with the task.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="gar_dolg_about_3">
        <text>You’ve mentioned about the “Freedom” morons?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="gar_dolg_about_31">
        <text>Total imbeciles and bloody scums. They can’t get it clear that the Zone is the world’s pest place. Besides they want to stretch the Zone all over the world, to the every single distant place. They may use all the possible and impossible means for their goal. I can’t wait when we finish them.</text>

        <text>Thanks.</text>

    <string id="gar_dolg_acces_0">
        <text>Why don’t you let anyone pass to the North?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="gar_dolg_acces_1">
        <text>Cos we don’t need that rabble at “Rostok”.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="gar_dolg_acces_2">
        <text>What’s there on the “Rostok”?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="gar_dolg_acces_21">
        <text>It concerns you not! You’ll learn when you come there.</text>

    <string id="gar_dolg_acces_3">
        <text>Listen, mate. I urgently need to go further. You understand?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="gar_dolg_acces_31">
        <text>Too insolent for the newbie. Or is it kinda gentle hint?! Well it may cost you about 500 rubles to get through.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="gar_dolg_acces_311">
        <text>Now we are talking. Take these money.</text>

    <string id="gar_dolg_guard_start_2">
        <text>Stop! You can’t go further! Newbies have nothing to deal with “Rostok”.</text>

        <text>You’re not a bad guy, go ahead.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="gar_dolg_guard_start_4">
        <text>Thanks my friend! You are doing quite well killing mutants. You can access the "Rostok" area any time.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="gar_dolg_guard_start_5">
        <text>Well, buddy, you are a mere pro in getting rid of monsters. When you are in "Rostok" area - make sure to come to see our leader. Possibly you will find common language with him.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="gar_dolg_guard_start_6">
        <text>Why are you standing? Move on.</text>

    </string>
    <string id="gar_dolg_start_3">
        <text>Hi, I’m glad that you also don’t like mutants. It was fun. You’re decent guy. We’ll admit you to the North.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="gar_dolg_start_4">
        <text>Hey. I'm glad you hate mutants too. It was funny. You are a good guy. We will let you pass to the north.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="gar_dolg_start_5">
        <text>Great! You gave them a hard time. Should everybody kill so many mutants as you, they would have vanished long ago. The path to the north is open to you.</text>

    <string id="gar_dram_novice_level_0">
        <text>Can you tell something about the Dump?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="gar_dram_novice_level_1">
        <text>Well there is nothing really essential in there. Dump as it is. Unless some maniacal bastard on the bridge that shoots everything that moves. It’s said that his head is wanted for reward. Moreover the northern road to “Rostok” is guarded by the “Duty” soldiers. You’d better don’t deal with those, guys in “Duty” a really gloomy ones. That’s it, I guess.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="gar_dram_novice_level_2">
        <text>Noteworthy information, thanks.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="gar_dramm_novice_start_2">
        <text>Thanks for saving. Now I’m in debt. How can I thank you… O! Information costs money, so listen. I’ve seen monolithians while moving from the Dark Valley. Morose guys in brown uniform. I’ve never noticed them coming to the border so closely. And the bandits who arranged big base in there, I’ve hardly made it to escape. So be careful, if you wander there.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="gar_dramm_novice_start_3">
        <text>Ho ho! Hi, mate! Thousand thanks for saving my ass. I promise I’ll requite like for like.</text>

        <text>Fine. I’ll be cautious.</text>

        <text>Can you tell about the local?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="gar_stalker_about_level_1">
        <text>Well, listen. We’re now standing at big fetid dump. All the bloody radioactive refuse and debris has been taken here after the accident in 1986. So it’s totally filled with that rubbish, above and beyond the anomalies here and there among the trash. That’s why the only one you can meet here is an ordinary newbies. Why the newbies gather bandits around them. Thus it’s better for you not to stay for long here. Further to the North – radioactive hot beds, trespassing without protection is fatal. If you go to the North, you’ll find the abandoned “Rostok” factory, stalkers’ bar in there you’ll find it with ease. Dark Valley to the East, gloomy, foggy place. “Agroprom” territory to the West. I’ll mark places on your map where you can get safely to.</text>
