        <text>Branded One, stalkers whisper about stalker Hawk to hve shown up in the area. Nobody has seen him for six months now. He tried locating a passage to the Zone center and disappeared without trace, only to reappear now. He was recently spotted in the Dark Valley, somewhere behind the Monolith base. When time permits, clarify what's about him.</text>

        <text>The military believe to have blocked all the exits from the Dark Valley. But there's an old road to the south, although you won't succeed without a car there. Find a vehicle and get outta there.</text>
