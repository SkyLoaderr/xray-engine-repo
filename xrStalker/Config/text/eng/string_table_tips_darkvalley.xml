        <text>Branded One, stalkers whisper about stalker Hawk to hve shown up in the area. Nobody has seen him for six months now. He tried locating a passage to the \nZone center and disappeared without trace, only to reappear now. He was recently spotted in the Dark Valley, somewhere behind the Monolith base. When \ntime permits, clarify what's about him.</text>
