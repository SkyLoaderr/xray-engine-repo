		<text>You don't understand, there's an emitter. No one has been able to come closer than half a kilometer - it makes a zombie out of anyone. Going there without a suit is just like suicide, get it?</text>

		<text>OK, but don't say I didn't warn you. Vasiliev worked on the laboratory problem. About a week ago, he and stalker by the name of Ghost attempted to get inside the laboratory. After several hours we felt a shake and emission stopped; after another hour, we got a signal from Vasiliev, it was coming from the swamp but then vanished. By the looks of things, Vasiliev is gone. Try to find his body: he had accurate information about the laboratory - where it is and how to get in. He might have also known how to turn off the emissionn. The laboratory entrance is most likely hidden in the basement of one of the buildings in the power plant area.</text>

		<text>Now your path to the laboratory is clear... except that if the source of the emission isn't destroyed and doesn't lose its power, you may not have enough time to get back.

		<text>Vasiliev was working on the lab issue. About a week ago he and a stalker called Ghost tried to get inside. A couple of hours later we felt a major tremor, and after another hour we picked up a signal from Vasiliev coming from the swamp, but it died away. And Vasiliev died away with it, it would seem. Try to find his corpse. He had the exact information on the lab and the way to get into it. There may even be info on deactivating that source of the emission.

		<text>Perhaps. At any rate, you must start by finding Vasiliev's body - that is the only chance of obtaining accurate information about the lab's location.
