		<text>OK, but don't say I didn't warn you. Vasiliev worked on the laboratory problem. About a week ago he and stalker by the name of Ghost attempted to get inside the laboratory. After several hours we felt a shake and radiation stopped; after one more hour we got a signal from Vasiliev, it was coming from the swamp but then vanished. By the looks of things, Vasiliev is gone. Try to find his body: he had accurate information about the laboratory - where it is and how to get in. He might have also known how to turn off the radiation. The laboratory entrance is most likely to be hidden in the basement of one of the buildings based on plant territory.</text>

In an hour we registered it again – it was coming from the direction of the swamps, but then died out... it seems that Vasiliev's life ended at the same time. If only we could find the body! Vasiliev was carrying dependable recording equipment that had to have registered accurate data on X16. And they surely could have found some important evidence.
