		<text>According to General Voronin, only Freedom has one of these guns. How I get it is my own business. I was told that one way would be to hang out with the Freedom stalker called Chef. The General says he likes his drink more than he should. I should stock up on vodka just in case I can use it.</text>

		<text>1: Today we went to the village again on a hunt. Same as always. \n\n 2: Where did that beast come from? Must have sneaked through near Radar. All the guys are down, I'm the only one standing… I'll try to sneak out at night… \n\n 3: I don't remember how I got out. It was pure hell... My head is splitting open - pictures, sounds, I don't know where they are coming from. Goddamn radiation. On top of that, the bloody detector is kaputt. I must rest to get some relief.</text>

		<text>Crap, those Duty assholes kicked us out from a fat place. They dug in near our farmstead. We didn't even have time to get our things from the attic. No big deal though - Freedom base is near, so they won't hang on too long.</text>

		<text>Today we shook down a few soldiers on their way to Radar - scored some RG-6s. They are awesome. Lukash took one, and Murk hid the other in the village, in one of the basements.</text>

		<text>1. The Devil made me go to Radar. I barely made it - a little slower and I would have made for just another exhibit with liquified brains.\n\n 2: Four thugs surrounded me like I was a three-year old. I did my part - didn't see their trap. I was only saved by their chattiness and greed. Instead of stuffing me full of lead, they jumped out and began disrobing me - got hooked on the suit. That was their last mistake; still, one of them caught me with a bullet... heh, I'm getting old...\n\n 3: By the time I arrived, Hawkeye's messenger was no longer breathing. Three bloodsuckers are a match for anyone, but this guy took out four of them, and a few more bloody trails lead out in different directions. The only information on him is a door code (19840519), but identifying the door it unlocks doesn't seem possible.\n\n 4: We intercepted a few army men on their way to Radar. They carried no documents or orders, but were very adequately equipped. I think I'll leave that RG-6 in the basement until I need it.</text>
