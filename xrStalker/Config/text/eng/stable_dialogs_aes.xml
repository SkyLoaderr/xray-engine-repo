    <string id="aes_sergeant_diallog_1015">
        <text>No, my friend. I'm not really adequate - it just looks to be so. I'm going to fry you and eat... in fact, forget the fry stuff.</text>

        <text>Like total newbies... hem... There was a radiochemical reconnaissance... conducted by the copters... they had too much confidence in those ones... and \nwhere obliterated in a jiffy...

    <string id="aes_sergeant_diallog_1019">
        <text>This is the case in point. Someone was really noisy there.</text>

    <string id="aes_sergeant_diallog_1020">
        <text>Maybe someone of us, alive... could settle there... We had... a task - to capture the path to Sarco... hk... khe... Sarcophagus... if something happens - we must \nwait for reinforcements..</text>

    <string id="aes_sergeant_diallog_1024">
        <text>There is the task force... as well, once we have failed, they'll begin... I though we'll make a skirmish there... keh... a bit... and the battle broke out here... Don't \nwalk straight the road...</text>
