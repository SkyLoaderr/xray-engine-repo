        <text>Was the explosion of 1986 the work of yours as well?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="oso_chernobyl_crush_1">
        <text>No! We have nothing to do with it. Most of us was only starting the scientific activity then. Someone just decided to gain promotion \nvia intensive mindwork and hence transgress the processing of reactor functionining. Human's blunder. As it's said, "Today, for \npeace the atom’s nursed; while Europe says it should be cursed".</text>

        <text>What are those "death trucks"?</text>

    <string id="oso_death_truck_1">
        <text>Any production has waste products. Nearly the half of all stalkers die during enlistment. We consider it to be a natural selection. \nThose who can't manage to bear it are removed. Someone thought that you couldn't stand the draft and you were located to one of \nthe trucks. But you proved to be stronger.</text>

        <text>What does your S.T.A.L.K.E.R. tatooo means?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="oso_stalker_1">
        <text>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. - is one of the traps, meant for concealing our project. The device itself is situated inside APP's sarcophagus. You \nare more inclined to call it Monolith. Everyone who desires the wish granting become our marionette. You receive the mark and \nyou're inculcated in that you have a task, which has to be accomplished. Something turned not right with you. Because you've been \ninstructed to kill yourself.</text>

    <string id="oso_what_about_me_1">
        <text>You're a small screw that dropped out of the mechanism. And the mechanism turned out to be that big, that we didn't notice you \nfalling out. Since the moment when Zone emerged, many have tried to get to its center and find out what's in there. But we can't \nafford it. The humanity isn't ready for it yet. Thus we've "recruited" braves, like you, tempting you with your own crapulence. And sent \nyou to protect the mystery of the Zone.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="oso_what_is_the_zone_0">
        <text>What is the Zone? How did it emerge?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="oso_what_is_the_zone_1">
        <text>Zone is a result of hasty intervention into the Earth's noosphere. Such an interference was followed by a local noosphere slit. \nSingular surgical cut. Zone is just a demonstration of this cut on the Earth.</text>

    <string id="oso_what_next_0">
        <text>What will happen to us?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="oso_what_next_1">
        <text>What will be next depends on you. You see, the Zone is swelling. We are trying to keep it back, but your vigor isn't infinite. Besides, \ntoo many of them were spent to struggle with you. You can't just eliminate us physically. All that you see here is just an illusion. \nOur bodies are in anabiosis deep under the soild. You can join us and we, with your strength and knowlegde, will be able to hold \nback the growing of the Zone. You may not join, but otherwise, you won't leave this room.</text>

    <string id="oso_who_are_you_1">
        <text>I'm not the only one. We are a group of well-known scientists, who decided to change the world. According to Vernadskiy theory the \nEarth is surrounded with the informational field - noosphere. It is closely connected with all the thinking beings on the Earth. We've \nmade a decision to make minor alterations to the noosphere, in order to utterly remove malice, violence and greed from human \nthoughts. But none of the human minds possesses the power enough to perceive the noosphere. We've combined our \nconsciousnesses into one and become the most intelligent being on the planet Earth.</text>

        <text>Why all that have happened in Chernobyl?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="oso_why_chernobyl_1">
        <text>Heh. It was the best option of all. First of all there are virtually no people left after the accident in 1986. We could function without \nbeing afraid of exposure. In the second place there are powerful antennas left nearby Chernobyl ever since USSR time, which were \nused in experiments on influencing human conscoiusnesses. In general here was the all the fundament which allowed us to \nestablish the connection with noosphere.</text>
