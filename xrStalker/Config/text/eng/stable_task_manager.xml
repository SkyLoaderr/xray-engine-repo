Everything was going as usual. There was a scouting expedition to the Dark Valley, we got down into the trench with Krivoi to cover the rest of the group, and then once I heard the howling, I was gripped by fear. Damn, I don't even remember how I got to the coordinate. When I returned to the base, Voronin almost shot me on the spot: he had just given me an enhanced canon, for good service, so to speak. And here...I paniced and took off so fast that I left the canon there. Could you bring it back for me, else where will I go now without a decent weapon.</text>
