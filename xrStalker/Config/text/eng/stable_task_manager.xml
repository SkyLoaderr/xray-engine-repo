The Duty guys and some of the old-timers have already gone to teach them a lessons, but we haven’t heard from them in a while… So why don’t you… eh… go and check on them.

A lair of creatures needs to be wiped out at the Dump. One of our groups is already working on it, so in case of trouble you’ll have a place to retreat. On the other hand, troubles are highly undesirable, because there really aren’t that many creatures, about ten, no more.

		<text>I'm having a confrontation with this one trader. Well, if he doesn't want to cooperate, the hell with him! But I won't let anyone start filthy rumors. In short, he needs to be wasted so the others don't get out of hand. Let them all know who's the boss here... </text>

		<text>I always said business and religion can't go together, they can never cross, and should never ever meddle in the other's affairs! It's just this padre, Lord forgive me, Diodor... well... he just can't see this simple truth. He keeps raving about artifact hunting, says that trading in them drives people to sin not just in the Zone, but in the whole world, on and on along those lines. Get this, he preaches the destruction of artifacts altogether!! See what he is up to? The worst bit is that he's actually got some converts! I've tried to approach this Diodor this way and other, but he just keeps at it. Here's the deal: you're going to send him upstairs wher he can preach all he likes... you get the point, right? And I'll give you a cool artifact. So, we've got a deal? </text>
