Thus, they can not only see with their eyes, but smell with them as well! We're getting ready for an operation on transplanting this miraculous eye to one of ... one of our voluntary assistants.

I hope you know that dogs belong to the vertebrates subtype... meaning their vertebral column starts with the head and ends with the tail. And here's the catch! One of my young collegues proved theoretically that the spine of the blind dogs - this is how you named this type of animals - starts from the tail, not from the head! Think of it, it totally turns upside down our assumptions pertaining to this area of knowledge. There are already some rather daring theories about human beings having around their sacrum a... well, this is a subject of many discussions. In short, we need the head of the dog, the blind dog, which through ignorance we considered to be its tail.</text>

	<string id="tm_kill_stalker_4_text">
		<text>The Fiend, aka Oleg Gusarov... used to serve in Spetsnaz. As long as he minded his own business, I had nothing against him, a loner is a loner. But I hear he's mustering a gang to crush down the cordon and take control over smuggling operations from the Zone. Now this is a major problem and it has to be solved quick. So will you do it? </text>

		<text>To kill a man preaching in the Zone against gathering and selling artifacts? Exactly. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="tm_kill_stalker_5_text">
		<text>I always said business and religion can't go together, they can never cross, and should never ever meddle in the other's affairs! It's just this padre, Lord forgive me, Diodor... well... he just can't see this simple truth. He keeps raving about artifact hunting, says that trading in them drives people to sin not just in the Zone, but in the whole world, on and on along those lines. Get this, he preaches the destruction of artifacts altogether!! See what he is up to? The worst bit is that he's actually got some converts! I've tried to approach this Diodor this way and other, but he just keeps at it. Here's the deal: you're going to send him upstairs wher he can preach all he likes... you get the point, right? And I'll give you a cool artifact. So, we've got a deal? </text>
