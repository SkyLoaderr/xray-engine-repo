		<text>That's much better, chum. Now give me all the information you've got, every little thing to the last scrap of paper. And don't even think of pulling anything funny 'cause that joke would be your last…</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dar_explorer_dialog_51">
		<text>I'm telling you, stop! I'm not roaming around this rat hole for nothing. Stop horsing around and tell me what you've found. We could even split it…</text>

		<text>Keep walking, stalker.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dar_explorer_dialog_8031">
		<text>I hate it when someone interrupts when I speak. Anyway, I came here for some important documents. If you've found something, spill it out or you'll be in trouble. If you haven't found anything, get lost and stop wasting my time.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dar_explorer_dialog_8041">
		<text>I hate it when someone interrupts when I speak. Gimme those documents if you don't want to part with your life.</text>
