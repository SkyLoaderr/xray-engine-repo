        <text>There you might find the largest military base ever seen. I'm not up on how many of them are there, but my experience says that it's not less than a platoon there. They are well armed, and you won't succeed in breaking through, but if you decide to - they'll wipe you out without any hesitation.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="agr_krot_about_agroprom_30">
        <text>It's better to be penetrated at night, but I guess that the base is heavily guarded in the nighttime, they've got outposts everywhere. Watch for the schedule of guards relieve, then you'll have a real chance to get into the territory undetected and leave it the same way. In general I've heard that there is a soldier hiding somewhere at the swamps, who escaped from this base. How haven't he been put away, I wonder? Press on him - he'll tell you everything.</text>

        <text>Artifacts? Why then the militaries attacked you? I can hardly believe that it was over the artifacts!</text>

        <text>Yes, I've heard about him, he was likely to make his living in these places, it's a pretty good spot here. But he has gone long ago, but I don't know exactly when and where. I know nothing more.</text>

    <string id="agr_krot_actor_hasnot_met_seriy_300">
        <text>I've got an information about the location of the Gunslinger's cache! Truly the cache is located not at the factory, but under it! Can you see this hole? This is one of the entrances to the tunnels under the factory, and I don't even know the exact size of the dungeons, but the cache is somewhere there!</text>

        <text>As far as you are Grey's friend, then it turns out that you are a friend of mine as well, especially after the mayhem with the militaries. If it were not for your timely help I guess I would have become the lunch for the blind dogs.</text>

    <string id="agr_krot_actor_met_seriy_1000">
        <text>Okay-okay. So what is with the cache?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="agr_krot_actor_met_seriy_150">
        <text>I know where Gunslinger's cache is situated. It is right here at the Agroprom or better to say under it. Tunnels are everywhere, they lead under the factory and not only there. But as for myself, I haven't got any desire to go there - I'll have to save my ass from the militaries, cure the wounds. Go there yourself if you wish to. I'll copy the information on your PDA.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="agr_krot_actor_met_seriy_1500">
        <text>How can I get into the tunnels?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="agr_krot_actor_met_seriy_200">
        <text>This is one of the variety of entrances, you'll get into one of the tunnels through it and then do as you like, I've got no map of these tunnels, while they're very long with an abundance of rooms and being very tangled.</text>

    <string id="agr_stalker_talk_level_1">
        <text>This is the territory of Agroprom Research Institute. The building itself is situated on the south-west. And the large factory to the north - is manufacturing and technology base of the institute. The building was abandoned for a long time, it has passed into momories, there is nothing to steal from there whatsoever. But recently militaries started to search for something there actively.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="agr_stalker_talk_level_2">
        <text>Tell me about the institute in detail.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="agr_stalker_talk_level_21">
        <text>This is a legendary institute. Until the catastrophe in 1986 there was only the lone standing building of Gramineae selection and genetics institute. And there was an experimental field on the territory of the factory. After the accident the insitute has been closed and the field was burned. And then it was remembered, whitewashed, fenced around, barracks were built. Factory was constructed on the fields. I don't have a clue what were they doing in that institute, but they didn't spare money, I'm telling you.</text>

        <text>Tell me about the factory in detail.</text>

        <text>This factory has been built in the end of 80s. Supposedly with the aim to build and check the cars, which are capable to work up the radioactive soil. But as far as I know, no one has seen a single car there. Now it's totally empty. Only stalkers like to stop there. It's said that this place is a safe one if not to poke a nose into the dark corners.</text>
