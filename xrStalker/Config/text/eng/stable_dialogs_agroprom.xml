		<text>Stalkers call this territory dead, radiation is too strong here... If you go deep into the area, you`ll reach the radioactive plains 
        and find shallow rusty lake. All lake is filled with remains of vehicles - a heap of rusty trash, covered with water. You can also find
        old scientific research institute and a factory, but I is all covered with some mutated muck. Don`t go there without gas-mask, too  
        dangerous.</text>

        Go North - you`ll reach the Yantar lake, rumors tell there is a scientists camp there.</text>
