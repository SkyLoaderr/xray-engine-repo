		<text>Thanks for the information.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="agr_factory_krot_start_1501">
		<text>Yes, I heard about that. They even say he used to "work" in these parts and Sharpshooter's stash is in the local basements. Rumour has it that his group's base was here too.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="agr_factory_krot_start_1502">
		<text>This is one of the many exits which will lead you into the interconnected basements. Once you're in there you're on your own - I don't have a map and the basement network is huge and confusing.</text>

	<string id="agr_factory_krot_start_3001">

		<text>Man that was a fight and a half - you wouldn't wish something like that on your worst enemy. Those army boys are getting pretty cocky!</text>

		<text>Where is Agroprom R&D Institute?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="agr_krot_about_agroprom_10">
		<text>Not far from here. Follow the road to the west and you'll come to the Institute gates.</text>

	<string id="agr_krot_about_agroprom_100">
		<text>I hear the military have set up a base there?</text>

		<text>Thanks for the information.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="agr_krot_about_agroprom_20">
		<text>Yeah, that they have. I'm not sure how many of them there are exactly but it's at least a platoon. They're well-armed and you've got no chance of breaking through - they'll take you down before you can say "hello". The best way of getting in is during the night 'cause the base is well-guarded during the day - they got checkpoints everywhere and anyway, I heard a soldier gone AWOL from that base is hiding in the marshes. If you can find him I'm sure you can shake some useful info out of him.</text>

		<text>What's going on?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="agr_krot_actor_hasnot_met_seriy_100">
		<text>Me and my boys found a nice little area full of artifacts but those army bastards attacked us for some reason. I don't know what the hell they wanted from us...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="agr_krot_actor_hasnot_met_seriy_200">
		<text>Yeah, I've heard about him. I think he used to "work" in this area - it's quite a good place, actually. He left here a long time ago; I don't know when it was exactly and I've got no clue where he was headed. That's everything I can tell you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="agr_krot_actor_hasnot_met_seriy_2000">
		<text>You weren't waiting here for no reason were you? Otherwise why would the Spetsnaz show up here?</text>

	<string id="agr_krot_actor_hasnot_met_seriy_250">
		<text>OK, I know something about Sharpshooter.</text>

	</string>
	<string id="agr_krot_actor_hasnot_met_seriy_400">
		<text>I'm not lying. I know that nobody trusts anyone here so you have little choice.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="agr_krot_actor_met_seriy_100">
		<text>Grey? Well, OK, listen. They say Sharpshooter used to have something like his headquarters here. We found one room in the basement - it looked perfect for a stash to be honest but we dug everything up there and didn't find jack shit. I'll give you the info about the stash, maybe you'll have better luck than us.</text>

	</string>
	<string id="agr_krot_actor_met_seriy_250">
		<text>I don't know anything else, I told you everything I knew and now you have to act on your own. Good luck to you, mate.</text>

		<text>What are you doing?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="agr_stalker_esc_20">
		<text>I'm coming back from the factory which is a bit further down the road. I don't know how but the army found out about our group. I didn't wait for them to make an appearance and buggered off as quickly as I could. I hope our boys got out of there 'cause otherwise they won't be alive for much longer - you saw the choppers yourself.</text>

		<text>Deal.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="agr_stalker_talk_about_ratcatcher1_111">
		<text>We have a local hero around here called Ratcatcher. He lives in the marshes. The man bred so many rats in the collectors that they'll eat those army bastards alive soon.</text>

	<string id="agr_stalker_talk_about_ratcatcher_20">
		<text>Yeah, there are a couple of places but you'll have to share some of your wealth, mate.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="agr_stalker_talk_about_ratcatcher_21">
		<text>It used to be pretty quiet but now the army has got all excited and started wasting everyone. They smoked the bandits out recently and I hear some managed to escape into the catacombs.</text>
	</string>

		<text>Thirty, deal?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="agr_stalker_talk_about_ratcatcher_40">
		<text>The exit from the railway tunnel is nearby. It's fairly safe in the dead end there. At least nobody has been eaten while sleeping...yet. \n Also, to the north-west of the factory you'll find a marsh with a carriage in it. You can get your head down inside it without worry too. The only thing is there's a shitload of radiation around it so it's best to approach it from the western side. Oh, and one more thing: a soldier has been spotted there. He's likely to be from the military base at the Institute. The poor bastard is probably crazy - he's been there for a couple of days and I doubt he'll survive much longer on his own.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="agr_stalker_talk_about_ratcatcher_9999">
		<text>Bye!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="agr_stalker_talk_level_0">
		<text>Tell me about this place.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="agr_stalker_talk_level_1">
		<text>This is the area around Agroprom R&D Institute. The Institute itself is to the south-west. The factory, which served as the Institute's technical production facility, is to the north. The buildings are long since abandoned and there's nothing to be had there but the army has been searching there very actively recently.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="agr_stalker_talk_level_2">
		<text>Tell me more about the Institute.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="agr_stalker_talk_level_21">
		<text>There are a load of legends about the Institute going around. Before the accident in 1986 the only thing here was the Institute of cereal crop selection and genetics. The area where the factory is now was used for experimental crop fields. After the accident they closed the institute and burned the fields. Then they remembered to whitewash the building, put up a fence around it and build some barracks. I don't know what they did at the Institute but they didn't have any shortage of funding, that's for sure.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="agr_stalker_talk_level_3">
		<text>Tell me more about the factory. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="agr_stalker_talk_level_31">
		<text>The factory was built at the end of the 80s. They said it was going to be used to build and test machines that could treat soil affected by radiation but as far as I know nobody ever saw a single machine come out of that plant. It's totally empty now which makes it a favourite spot for stalkers. I hear the place is pretty safe as long as you avoid the dark corners.</text>

		<text>Hello.</text>

		<text>What's up?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="agr_swamp_ratcatcher_talks1_011">
		<text>Tell me about the collector. How do I get inside? Where are the exits and entrances?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="agr_swamp_ratcatcher_talks1_0111">
		<text>It's dangerous inside the collector. There are six entrances and two of them are in the area around the Institute where the military have set up a base. That area is patrolled and the captain keeps the patrol rota in his armoury.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="agr_swamp_ratcatcher_talks1_01111">
		<text>How do you know all that?</text>
	</string>

		<text>Who are you?</text>

	<string id="agr_swamp_ratcatcher_talks_120">
		<text>Catacombs?</text>

	<string id="agr_swamp_ratcatcher_talks_141">
		<text>What are you going to do now?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="agr_swamp_ratcatcher_talks_20">
		<text>I am from the recon unit. They sent us into the catacombs to see what's going on below the base. It's hell down there man, I tell you. I was the only one to run away...everyone else is probably dead meat by now. I don't want to go back to the base - those bastards are always using us to plug all the holes in this damn Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="agr_swamp_ratcatcher_talks_30">
		<text>Underground tunnels. They go from the Institute to outside the area around it - I'll show you the entrances. I don't have maps of the catacombs themselves.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="agr_swamp_ratcatcher_talks_40">
		<text>At the HQ. It's on the second floor of the Institute. That's where they keep those damn papers. But it's a mission getting there.\nBy day the area is totally infested with patrols but there are less of them at night. I'll tell you this for free: if you wanna get inside you'll have to go through the catacombs - you stand no chance at the gate.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="agr_swamp_ratcatcher_talks_50">
		<text>Hmm. I don't know. I am a deserter according to military law and I need to get out of the Zone somehow. \n When we first got here there was a Zaporozhets in the garage that was almost working. I brought it back to life in half an hour but that damn captain took it for himself claiming he should have it according to the code. He drove it around along a road around here and dumped it in the rain by the gate. If only I could get that car - making a run for it is much safer on wheels!</text>
