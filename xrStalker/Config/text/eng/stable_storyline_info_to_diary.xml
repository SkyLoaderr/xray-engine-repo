        <text>1: Today we set off to the village for a round of art hunting. Everything as usual. \n\n2: Where these beasts come from? Must be from Radar, where else. All fell dead, and I’m sitting on tower waiting for the beasts to calm down. Will try to escape by night…\n\n3: I don’t remember how I pulled out – but it was a mere hell… My head is splitting – images, sounds, I don’t know where they come from, damn radiation. And the bitched meter broke down. I have to take some rest, will get better then.</text>

        <text>Damn, bastards from “Duty” have ousted us from the booty-plentiful area. They’ve entrenched around our hamlet. We haven’t even managed to pick up our stuff from the garret. It’s ok, the “Freedom’s” base is nearby, so it won’t take long before they are smoked out of there.</text>

        <text>Today we held up some military going to the Radar and secured a couple of RG6s. Excellent stuff. One was grabbed by Lukash, another one was hidden in house basement by Ugryumy in the village.</text>

        <text>1: What the hell forced me to go to the Radar, could barely escape it – another little bit and there would be one more exhibit with brains thinned out. \n\n2: Four of gangsters surrounded me as toddler, my fault too – failed to spot the ambush. I was saved by their talkativeness and greed, instead of riddling me, they jumped out and wanted to undress me first – hankered after the suit. That was their last mistake, one of them though hurt me a bit, well – I’m getting older…\n\n3: Gunslinger’s messenger was breathless by the time I arrived. Yes, not everyone can cope with three bloodsuckers, and this one got four down and several bloody traces stretch in different directions. The only information he had with him is the door code (19840519), but it is unclear right now which the door it is.\n\n4: We caught some military going to the Radar. Had no documents and orders with them, but at least we got ammunition resupplied. Will hide away my RG6 in the basement for now, will pick up later.</text>

        <text>These zombies from Monolith base need people. As if for some kind of experiments, I didn’t quite dig in. They pay with artefacts and the expensive ones. If you send them the imprisoned, tell your lads that the password is NUCLEAR WINTER. I described your uniform to Monolith guys, so make sure you put it on when going. If they take you for some shitheads, they’ll take to their guns.\n You surely get it who is to be rewarded for the info, right?\n Zmey.</text>

        <text>Restricted.\nTo: Leader, “THRUTH” project \nKGB colonel V.Ì. Kruchelnikov \nFrom: Commander, «Search-2» group, \ncaptain D.F. Maksimenko \n\nReport.\n\nIn period from 12.05.2012 to 25.05.2012 our group incorporating with KGB task force section has been inspecting the facilities of former “Agroprom” research institute, which researched the problem of farming on lands contaminated with radioactivity. The very first inspections draw suspicion upon their non-farming activities of the last 2-3 years before the “X” day. \nFurther worse, the first part of collected materials was sent under the escort to Dytyatky army post on May, 16th, but according to the information provided by army post commander lieutenant V.P. Chuguykin no one came for that data. Radio communication with the center is unstable and recently because of the increasing Zone activity communication service is out at all.. We don’t send any other Agroprom materials as the remaining group is reluctant to be split. During the delivery of first part of collected materials two soldiers of the escort died: sergeant R.D. Dubko and ensign K.P. Ivanets. We couldn’t fetch the bodies, since all the bodies were missing. \nColonel, sir, I insistently demand on considering this situation. With all the proper respect sir, we’re at the breaking point. My people are dying and no one has any mere dealings with us and our tasks!!!. Where a hell is that damn group of military stalkers I was promised? Or our replacement? Where are the promised air support and rations?!!! For what damn reason an antique tank without any fuel or ammunition was sent here? Yes, it has arrived, inane wonder of engineering… Mutants jeer at it… Stop teasing us!!!.. If the situation doesn’t change, I’ll take my men away from the Zone on my own… Got that?\n\n28.05.2012. KGB captain Maksimenko D.F.</text>

        <text>You asked me to find out about the location of Gunslinger's stash. Listen, here's what I discovered. Not far from SRI Agroprom there is a factory. Make sure you circle this one around from the north. Nearby the fence breach you will spot an entrance leading to underground. Get inside to find yourself on spiral stairs. Climb down to procede to the spacious indoor area. There in the far corner you will locate the stash. Beware of mutants though, they are said to have densely occupied the underground territories. And don't forget to share a lump of loot with the one who has helped you out with the info.</text>

        <text>Received from Phantom: \n \n Gunslinger, I've got very disappointing news. Fang has perished. We were ambushed at the village near the depots. And in my opinion they were waiting for a long time. Threesome. Looked like usual neutrals. Fang smelled them somehow. You know about his keen scent. Two of them were killed - obviously they were total newbies, and the third one appeared to be much more clever - camped in 100 meters with Screw-gun. So Fang is gone. So only two of has can go to the Center next time. And there is more: Those two had our description. I don't have a tiny clue who ever said that. Though many have grudge against us. The third is gone. One of the free lancers to my mind. Heavy scar on the face. Bright eyes. I'll try to find him. \n That's the way the cookie crumbles. Good luck and watch out. \n Phantom \n \n To Phantom \n \n "Hi mate. \n I leave an info for ye. That's the way to get in touch. I've noticed somebody shadowed. \n Dude, I'm gone to the North: to where we've been: I'll try to get through myself: Sorry, but I don't have enough time for that: Explain later. \n And that moron, who killed Fang will regret the day when he was born... I'm irritated... You'd inquire about who is he, and I'll be back soon, we'll see to it. \n Meet at our common friend. You know who's he and where he is. :) \n Good luck. \n Gunslinger" \n \n To Gunslinger. \n \n "Hello. Been there. Haven't met you. Your trip to the center alone was all for nothing. Although that's not the point. Where and at whom I should look for you is most certainly familiar :) \n Phantom"</text>

        <text>Received from Bugay: \n Seriy, I found out that Mole's grouping has gone towards Agroprom's factory. Searching for Gunslinger's cache, want to become familiar with his trip to the North. Supposed to know the rough cache place. Will camp on the gactory during the search. So, the point is that you are wandering nearby - go chat with them. You're a communicative person indeed - so outtalk them to give you information. Huh? \n \n Send to Bugay: \n Bull, listen, I won't peep there readily. Militaries are fumbling in there. I don't wanna have a bullet and all. However, I understand they'll get back to the Bar later on. And I'm gonna camp in Garage on the Dump. Got a task from scientists for bloodsuckers' heads. So, when it is comming back - I'll manage to intercept them.</text>
