----------------------------
done, ~7% perf-gain		:	intelligent	RT-switches sheduling + give some time to complete RT-rendering
done, ~5.5% perf-gain	:	cull point-light frustums against real frustum
done, works OK			:	fixed coordinate system for point lights - should minimize flickering
						:	clip every-light frustums against real frustum - difficult
						:	scissoring ???
----------------------------
3*32	bit RTs		- position/normal compression
xrLC geometry selection for point/spot lights

bilinear/q-linear filter for cubemaps
bicubic filter for spot shadows
2*DXT5	bumpmaps	- better quality, 16bit total
detail	bumpmaps	- better quality
work out blooming	(again)
work out skybox		(again)
work out tonemapping(?)
sRGB convert diffuse???
reverse culling	for spot/point with initial clears - should avoid most biasing ?
----------------------------
perspective shadow maps and all that stuff Gary talks about
