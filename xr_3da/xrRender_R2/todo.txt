* shadowed		point lights
* unshadowed	point lights
* bloom
* nv30
* xrLC format
* bump shaders
* ability to specify texture + transform on P-lights
* ability to project texture on directional lights
* skybox/fog

----------------------------
done, ~7% perf-gain	:	intelligent	RT-switches sheduling + give some time to complete RT-rendering
					:	cull point-light frustums against real frustum
					:	clip every-light frustums against real frustum - difficult
					:	scissoring ???
----------------------------
bilinear/q-linear filter for cubemaps
bicubic filter for spot shadows
fixed coordinate system for point lights - should minimize flickering
3*32	bit RTs		- position/normal compression
2*DXT5	bumpmaps	- better quality, 16bit total
detail	bumpmaps	- better quality
work out blooming	(again)
work out skybox		(again)
xrLC geometry selection for point/spot lights
reverse culling	for spot/point with initial clears - should avoid most biasing
----------------------------
perspective shadow maps and all that stuff Gary talks about
