----------------------------
done, ~7% perf-gain		:	intelligent	RT-switches sheduling + give some time to complete RT-rendering
done, ~5.5% perf-gain	:	cull point-light frustums against real frustum
done, works OK			:	fixed coordinate system for point lights - should minimize flickering
						:	clip every-light frustums against real frustum - difficult
						:	scissoring ???
done, works OK			:	3*32	bit RTs		- position/normal compression
done, works OK			:	bilinear/q-linear filter for cubemaps
done, works OK			:	1*DXT5	bumpmaps	- lower quality, 8 bit, faster
----------------------------
						:	U8V8	encoding of encodeRG
						:	L8		encoding of encodeB + mov instead add
						:	U8V8	encoding of material
----------------------------
work out tonemapping	(?)
xrLC geometry selection for point/spot lights

bicubic filter for spot shadows
detail	bumpmaps	- better quality
work out blooming	(again)
work out skybox		(again)
sRGB convert diffuse???
reverse culling	for spot/point with initial clears - should avoid most biasing ?
----------------------------
perspective shadow maps and all that stuff Gary talks about
