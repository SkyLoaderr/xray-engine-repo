Roadmap
overal directions
	content/tools/plugins
			faster content authoring (deeper integration with standart art-packages)
			shorter content delivery (art-package to engine)
	no/or short preprocessing
	complete integration with editors - WISIWIG - what I see is what I get, including lighting
	fast run/edit/run cycle or even edit while run
	improved scripting
	no "level" concept, continous reality
	deep atmosphere simulation
