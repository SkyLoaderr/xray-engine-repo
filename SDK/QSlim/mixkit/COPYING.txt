Clarifications/Exceptions
------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) If you link the MixKit library with other files to produce an
executable, this does not by itself cause the resulting executable to
be covered by the GNU General Public License.  This includes static
linking of the library.  Your use of that executable is in no way
restricted on account of linking the MixKit library code into it.
This exception DOES NOT invalidate any other reasons why the
executable file might be covered by the GNU General Public License

(2) A few pieces of code in this library have been adapted from other
sources and may be distributed under terms other than the LGPL.
Further details can be found in the relevant files.

	- MxTriProject.cxx contains code which is copyrighted by
	  Hugues Hoppe and is free for non-commercial use only.

	- The getopt* files were taken from the GNU C Library v2.0.4
	  and are copyrighted by the FSF.  They are still covered by
	  the LGPL.

	- MxMat[34]-jacobi.cxx are both derived in part from Numerical
	  Recipes in C.  They are free for non-commercial use only.

	- The intersection code in MxFitFrame-2.cxx was written by
	  David Eberly, but it may be freely distributed.
